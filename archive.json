This is especially the case with CDNs relying on anycast.\r\n\r\nThese facts lead to the conclusion that if we choose RRtype as the method, there would often be cases where the DNS record of the ESNIKey and the TLS server would be required to be operated by different entities.\r\n\r\nThis essentially means that there would be high risk of ESNIKey record and the key in TLS server becoming out-of-sync for large amount of deployments.\r\n\r\nHaving such _additional_ risk in operation for a nice-to-have feature like ESNI would be unacceptable for many operators.\r\n\r\nPS. Using TXT records with prefix sounds good to me because we can use CNAME to delegate the ESNIKey when an APEX name is used to serve the website.",

This is because sending packets to an non-validated address is an vector for amplification attacks. We can resolve the issue by sending the certificate chain along with the ESNIKey and using an encrypted variant of Cached Certificate Extension.\r\n\r\nWe also revive the possibility of doing 0-RTT using semi-static key, because the key will be signed by the certificate.\r\n\r\nI think that providing performance improvement might give people more incentive to start using ESNI.",

The text says:\r\n~~~\r\nAs noted in Section 5.3, in Fronting Mode the hidden server will generally not know the true SNI. It is possible for the fronting server to communicate the true SNI to the hidden server, but at the cost of having that communication not be unmodified TLS 1.3. The basic idea is to have a shared key between the fronting server and the hidden server (this can be a symmetric key) and use it to send Z at the beginning of the connection before the ClientHello. The hidden server can then decrypt ESNI to recover the true SNI.\r\n\r\nAn obvious alternative here would be to have the fronting server forward the true SNI, but that would allow the fronting server to lie. In this design, the attacker would need to be able to find a Z which would expand into a key that would validly AEAD-encrypt a message of his choice, which should be intractable (Hand-waving alert!).\r\n~~~\r\nWhat I don't see is a mention that the network transmission between the fronting server and the hidden server  could be spied upon.

In that case fine, though it might be worth clarifying.\r\n\r\nThe other concern I had was risking of turning this into another OCSP (where network failure and attack basically look the same so clients end up ignoring both), but I guess that with DoH, DPRIVE and DNSSEC an attack here is much harder to pull off.

You can use an HTTP connect tunnel, traverse a CNAME (or 3), or engage in some alt-svc load balancing and, while these things all change the DNS name you lookup and connect() to, they don't change the SNI.\r\n\r\nwhat about eSNI? the keys are a property of the server, not really the origin. It seems really hard to coordinate this across administrative domains.\r\n\r\nThe case I'm particularly worried about is where more than one hosting provider is in the mix.. ISTM a typical way of doing this is LB'ing DNS responses with CNAMEs. (e.g. 50% of www.example.com gets CNAME www.cdnA.com and 50% gets www.cdnB.com).. We've got folks from 2 CDNs as active contributors here who know better than I, but this kind of level of indirection to get you CDN agility seems pretty common.. we would want cdnA and cdnB to be able to each use their own keys.\r\n\r\nEven without agility, its a pretty common pattern for an origin to maintain control of their own DNS and only delegate to a CDN under load/whatnot and do that via cname...\r\n\r\nthat argues to me to allow _esni TXT records on the server lookup, not just the origin name. Perhaps they could override the _esni at the origin scope but that seems like a way to trigger the misconfiguration fallback path.\r\n\r\nAlso, what about connect tunnels where you do do SNI, but don't traditionally do DNS at all?\r\n\r\n",

As you said, certain CDNs do not provide DNS as a service and their customers use their own DNS. Please see my comment on https://github.com/ekr/draft-rescorla-tls-esni/issues/7#issuecomment-388531906.\r\n\r\nRegarding the multi-CDN use-case, I do not think there is a easy solution.\r\n\r\nOne way of supporting that kind of configuration will be to do the following:\r\n1. (instead of querying for A and _eni) client only queries for A. Let's consider example.com is queried for and 1.2.3.4 is returned.\r\n2. client then connects to the return address via https to obtain the ESNIKeys (i.e. https://1.2.3.4/.well-known/esni-keys/example.com\r\n3. client connects to 1.2.3.4 with ESNI specifying \"example.com\"\r\n\r\nBut this has more overhead, looks more like TLS tunneling...\r\n\r\nHonestly, I'd prefer to not covering multi-CDN use-case.

Rather, I would argue that `_esni.a.example.com` should be used in that case, due to the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* some APIs used for querying a hostname (or a DNS record) might resolve CNAME's by itself\r\n  * `getaddrinfo` is one of such APIs, though it does not provide you the ability to query TXT records\r\n* we can fully parallelize the address resolution and the ESNI key resolution if we select `_esni.original-host` as the name\r\n\r\nIf we are _not_ going to use the original hostname, I wonder if we could use the final result rather than the intermediate result (e.g., assuming that a.example.com results to 192.0.2.1, query `_esni.1.2.0.192.in-addr.apa`). That solves the API issue and the multi-CDN use-case, with the downside being that the queries cannot be parallelized.",

I'd assume that we would want to handle ESNI record lookup within the stack as well.\r\n\r\nafaict the SNI information actually comes from tls.Config (Falling back to mail.google.com only if not provided).. this is no doubt also the information used to authenticate the cert.. https://golang.org/src/crypto/tls/tls.go?s=3255:3347#L88\r\n\r\nThe TLS stack is going to need both pieces of information. So which should it use?\r\n> \r\n> Therefore, the name used to lookup the ESNI record cannot be the origin name, which is specific to the behavior defined in HTTP (alt-svc), which operates above the TLS stack. \r\n\r\nno - the origin name is the SNI name even with alt-svc. It might not be the host name.\r\n\r\n> It needs to be the hostname that is used for the name resolution (or a name that is derived from that).\r\n> \r\n\r\nI think that's defensible but for different reasons (key management flexibility). but I would argue against this as we don't really want you using large sets of keys\r\n\r\n> My understanding is that TLS stacks on other programming language often has the same abstraction; i.e. handle name resolution inside in the TLS connection establishment call (or the TCP connection establishment call).\r\n\r\nIf a stack can't support alt-svc, then this isn't a problem - the name is the same everywhere :)\r\n\r\nIf a stack does support alt-svc then it has 2 names to deal with.. one is the name used for SNI and auth, and the other is the one used for TCP. (or perhaps it doesn't do TCP on its own).\r\n\r\nAll this issue is trying to do is decide whether the name we lookup for ENSNI/TXT is the same as the name we lookup for A/AAAA.. I'm going to say that they don't necessarily have to match. (i.e. your A could be for the alt-svc but your txt/esni is always going to be for the origin - which is the same thing you put in your CH.\r\n\r\nI'll make a pr.",

Actually we might be required to do that, if we want to prevent a client-facing server downgrading the crypto in the split server scenario.\r\n\r\nOTOH, I am not sure if we would want to use a _separate_ key share for ESNI, because that would require additional CPU cost.

That means that if we are going to have separate key shares but the algorithm collides, the client will be spending 17% more CPU cycles (i.e. 1 key generation + 2 derivations vs. 2 key generations and 2 derivations).\r\n\r\nConsidering the cost, I think that we'd be tempted to try reuse the key-share for two purposes (i.e. ESNI and TLS handshake), even if we define separate key exchange fields for the two.\r\n\r\nAnd that in turn make me wonder what the value is for having separate key exchange fields.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, I do not oppose to allowing client send multiple key shares or allowing server send HRR when ESNI is involved, but I prefer using the value of the KeyShares extension for carrying the ECDH key being used to encrypt ESNI.",

The server will fail to find the private key that matches the ESNIKeys being used by the client (based on the value of record_digest), and the handshake will fail (that is the defense we implemented in #24).\r\n\r\n> This works even against a non-ESNI servers.\r\n\r\nI think that this is true. One way to fix the issue will be to use the value of ESNIKeys as an input to the Key Schedule (see #66), but a fix like that will not work with unmodified hidden server in Split mode. \r\n\r\nHaving that said, I am not sure if this is kind of an attack we need to fix. An attacker that can tamper the DNS responses can mount a DoS attack in a simpler way: send a negative response to an A query. Our model of sending unauthenticated ESNIKeys over DNS is based on the perception that DoS or preventing ESNI from working is possible when unauthenticated transmission of DNS is involved, but that does not open _new_ attack vectors.\r\n\r\n> There's also a weaker attack in which the client-facing server just sends a weaker share in ESNIKeys.

Googling also tells me that managed DNS services like Route 53 and Azure DNS provide the capability, although surprisingly they use different escape sequences ([Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/ResourceRecordTypes.html#TXTFormat) uses `\\` + 3 octal, [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/azure/dns/dns-faq) uses `\\` + 3 decimal).",

      "body": "I don't know that I can give out my advice here before, so I had written an e-mail to draft-rescorla-tls-esni@ietf.org and that's my first time to send an email to IETF. I don't know whether sending an e-mail is the right thing, so I would paste it here again.\r\n\r\nI'm not a native English speaker, I would apologize for my poor English first.\r\n\r\n\r\n### DNS record disadvantage\r\n\r\n#### 1.Impossible for wildcard A or AAAA record\r\n\r\nIt isn't possible for us to set a txt record for wildcard A or AAAA record (_esni.*.example.com. 60S IN TXT \"...\" \"...\"). \r\nThe same problem as https://github.com/ekr/draft-rescorla-tls-esni/issues/79 mentioned.\r\n\r\n#### 2.Publishing a public key using DNS is very inconvenient and insecure. \r\n\r\nIn general, we can't change the DNS record very conveniently (except some DNS which provide API), so that most domain owners won't change the key very often. \r\n\r\nAnd in some cases, domain owners host their site at host service providers (I don't know how to explain that in English. Host service provider use one physical or virtual server to host many sites) once the provider want to change the ESNI public key, all owners on this server need to change their txt record on time, which is very inconvenient and nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nThe lack of frequently changing public key and the lack of Perfect Forward Security only provide us little security.\r\n\r\n#### 3.DNS record limited only exist domains can enable ESNI\r\n\r\nAs DNS record is needed to be set, only the owner of a exist and valid domain can enable ESNI.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes we want to use encrypted-sni as a private entry. For example, I configured my server that client hello with the sni \"vps.panel\" would lead to the vps control panel ( I issued a cert for \"vps.panel\" from my own PKI ). Though I configured that the server must verify my identity using a client certificate, I don't want this private sni to be known to the public. But your draft's method won't allow this use case as \"vps.panel\" isn't a valid domain name, so that I won't be able to own this domain and set a DNS record for it.\r\n\r\n#### 4.Local DNS (hosts) won't work\r\n\r\nThe hosts file can only take the place of A and AAAA record and won't be able to set public key in hosts in the near future.\r\n\r\n#### 5.Requirements to the server is too high\r\n\r\nThis ESNI draft requires that the server can the decrypt the sni which is encrypted by any public key. This means that the server has to take hold all ESNI private keys. However, I think that it's not proper.  \r\nTo CDN service provider like Cloudflare, it means that one Cloudflare server has to storage all private ESNI keys of the websites hosted on it.  \r\nIn my opinion, the browser should encrypt the sni using all public keys found in the DNS record and add a few invalid ESNI along with those, to prevent the attacker identify the real sni from the number of public keys.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Purpose Enhancement - Wall-resistent\r\n\r\nIn some countries (e.g. China, North Korea, Iran) , people may want to use ESNI to break the government's GreatFireWall, which blocks people from visiting some website.\r\n\r\nThe wall isn't just a wall, but a very complicated system which can modify DNS resolve result ( DNSSEC isn't common ). They can simply block all _esni txt record, so that all browsers can' get the public key and downgrade to cleartext-sni.\r\n\r\nIf ESNI can be used with SNI Proxy, it would be a good solution to break the wall. However the DNS record limited only the owner can enable ESNI ( Another disadvantage of DNS :D )\r\n\r\n\r\n### My suggestions\r\n\r\nI think some ideas of https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption/ is quite good. One good idea is to use a certificate to authenticate the Client-Facing Server instead of publishing a public key. My main idea is to introduce a series of HTTP headers like HSTS and HPKP. I will give an example below:\r\n\r\nFirstly, I would introduce these headers\r\n( These names may be not proper due to my poor English )\r\n\r\n```\r\nESNI:(preload);(includeSubdomains);max-age=??\r\nIf ESNI header presents in the response, it means this domain enables ESNI. Otherwise, the browser MUST ignore other ESNI-* headers.\r\ne.g.\r\nESNI:preload;includeSubdomains;max-age=31536000\r\n\r\nESNI-Resolve:{address};max-age=??\r\n{address} can be either FQDN or IP(s) the purpose is to hide the real domain during DNS resolve. The server MUST keep this header up-to-date. This header just like a cacheable CNAME record.\r\ne.g. \r\nESNI-Resolve: server233.domain-cdn.com;max-age=31536000\r\nESNI-Resolve: 0.0.0.0/16;max-age=2592000\r\nESNI-Resolve: 1.1.1.1;max-age=2592000\r\n\r\nESNI-Trust:{address or pin-hash};max-age=??\r\n{address} is the same as above. The only difference is that the FQDN can contain wildcard.\r\n{pin-hash} is similar to HPKP's pin-hash.\r\nCan have more than one this header in the HTTP Response. (Explain later)\r\ne.g.\r\nESNI-Trust:fqdn{ *.domain-cdn.com};max-age=31536000\r\nESNI-Trust:ip{0.0.0.0/16};max-age=31536000\r\nESNI-Trust:pin-hash{X523zEOQCuEJeU6PzewOGkKCRX+YLvfAsCYJbQubCuE=};max-age=31536000\r\n\r\n\r\nESNI-Policy:{policy};max-age=??\r\n{policy} can be \"force-encrypted-sni\", \"retry-clear-sni\", \"allow-dns-re-resolve\", \"disallow-dns-re-resolve\" defines the action if error happens using ESNI. \r\nCan have more than one this header in the Response. (Explain below)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to have more than one header with the same name, but we may construct these in to a structure and encode (e.g.base64) into one header. The header may be very big, but don't worry, only the first response contains it, HTTP2 will automatically compress them into a few bits in the later response.\r\n\r\nWhen the first time I visit https://www.example.com , I just do the normal tls1.3 hand shake with clear-text sni. The server just do what it should do, but the response MUST contain those ESNI headers if ESNI is enabled. The browser MUST remember these headers ( unless in incognito mode )\r\n\r\nWhen the second time I visit https://www.example.com , the browser SHOULD NOT query DNS resolve for www.example.com, instead, it should visit the FQDN/IP mentioned in the ESNI-Resolve header. And the browser MUST NOT send clear-text sni in the ClientHello, instead, send a CH without sni or a special CH indicates using ESNI.  The Client-Facing Server  send back certificate, the browser validates the certificate and makes sure the certificate contains at least one FQDN/IP mentioned in the ESNI-Trust header. If mismatch, check the ESNI-Policy and determine whether to retry or not. \r\nAnd then re-handshake with the server with encrypted-ClientHello in the 0RTT data or another CH extension. \r\n( similar to draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption method )\r\n\r\nMy suggestions' advantages and disadvantages are nearly the same as draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption method. It provides PFS, don't need to change the Split-Mode Server and solved some part of DNS sniffing. But the disadvantage is obvious too, the first hand shake can't be encrypted and the ESNI-Resolve may become incorrect over time. It needs to handshake twice, however, it provided PFS and I think it worth it. And if multiple sites are hosted on the same server (e.g.CDN, Host Service Provider), we just need to do the second handshake, which eliminate the risk of DoS attack in some level.... And I think 0RTT symmetric decryption is better than asymmetric decryption.\r\nSetting max-age too big or too small both have some risks, and I don't know how to solve it.\r\n\r\n**If you don't like the idea of authenticating the Client-Facing Server, you can simply replace the ESNI-Trust header's content into a public key and use your method. But I don' think set a static public key is a good idea ( explained in some part of DNS disadvantage ).**\r\n\r\nAll in all, we can't have both efficiency, performance and security,  reliability. You should make up your mind and choose whether to provide perfect security or perfect performance. I prefer the former.\r\n\r\nI know that my idea is similar to draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption than yours. However, you are the candidate for TLS WG, so I hope you can think it over. But I do agree with your idea that \"no need to don't stick out\" or simply \"we can stick out\" :D",

      "body": "issue #7 briefly discussed the choice of a _esni DNS prefix for the TXT record. I think we should revisit that.\r\n\r\nMy primary concern is that using 2 different names for the addressing and key information makes DNS aliasing un-necessarily complicated.\r\n\r\nConsider the case where www.example.com is a customer of bigHoster.com and bigHoster.com is deploying ESNI for all its customers.\r\n\r\nA classic way to do this is to have www.example.com be a CNAME for host1.bighoster.com\r\n\r\nunfortunately to use bighoster.com's new ESNI infrastructure www.example.com would need to add a CNAME record for _esni.www.example.com as well. So the ESNI deployment requires DNS changes outside of the org deploying ESNI, which is going to limit its deployment, which in turn is going to limit the breadth of its anonymity pool. :(\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I've been told that anecdotally putting names under a CNAME is legal but error prone. RFC 1912 seems to have some language that suggests its not even legal (though that is informational).\r\n\r\nIf the ESNI information were instead stored without a prefix then the alias would automatically apply as the CNAME applies to all the RR's of a hostname.\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for choosing the prefix was to avoid collisions in the TXT space, so it makes sense to also reopen #40 and use a non TXT RR type if we drop the prefix. I think the consensus is moving towards that being fine.\r\n\r\nThis would also resolve #79 to harmonize esni with existing dns deployments.\r\n\r\n",

Because a wildcard will much all names with the designated type, including the `_esni` prefix.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following configuration will support ESNI for all the hostnames under example.com, like `a.example.com`, `b.c.example.com`, because any query for `_esni.*.example.com` resolves to `*.example.com`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n*.example.com.

But it's practical.\r\n\r\nI am not sure if we would prefer to require alias resolution for every ESNI client.\r\n\r\nImplementation wise, it's about reimplementing what DNS recursor usually does in the stub resolver.

See section 2.3 of 7838\r\n```\r\n Note that the SNI information provided in TLS by the client will be\r\n   that of the origin, not the alternative (as will the Host HTTP header\r\n   field value).\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe alternate is essentially just a cname for the origin. If host b is an alternate for origin a, in order to use the alternate you look up the DNS a/aaaa of b, do a TCP connect to b, and then use sni=a and expect a certificate valid for a. (indeed the point of the SNI is to tell the server what certificate you expect to see)\r\n\r\nWith esni you would continue to do all of those things, except of course sni=encrypted(a).. and the question becomes where do you find the key used for the encryption. Is it the ESNI DNS record of a (the origin) or b (the alternate host). That's the question the text is trying to resolve - it says to use a (the origin).

Thus, even with SNI encryption, an attacker which can enumerate the set of ESNI-enabled domains supported by a client-facing server can guess the correct SNI with probability at least 1/K, where K is the size of this ESNI-enabled server anonymity set. This probability may be increased via traffic analysis or other mechanisms.\r\n\r\nI think this is too restrictive. If I have 100000 names and 100 IPs and for all queries I randomly return four out of my 100 IPs chosen randomly, I still provide the same anonymity set but I violate the SHOULD. How about: `Content providers operating in Split Mode SHOULD ensure that the A and AAAA records for ESNI-enabled server names do not allow identifying the server name from the IP address. This can for example be achieved by always returning the same records for all ESNI-enabled names, or by having the function that picks addresses from a pool not depend on the server name.

Maybe browsers can use smaller sized payloads when greasing the ESNI extension, under the premise that they would be sometimes using the maximum.\r\n\r\nThe size of the extension being different from when it is actually used does not matter in practice, because an observer can typically tell if ESNI was used by checking if the unencrypted SNI record contains the fallback domain name (here I assume that we adopt #134).",

The ESNI records would be under _esni.ptrnam.dom\r\n\r\n3. As with most PTR records ptrnam.dom is expected to have exactly one AAAA or A record pointing back at the same IP (if the starting IP is IPv6 only AAAA need to satisfy this, if IPv4 only A, the same ptrnam.dom can be used for one IPv4 and one IPv6 address if the ESNI records would be the same).\r\n\r\n4.

ESNI private key protection can be much stronger when it is not shared among all the servers.  The private key may be kept in protected hardware and/or in volatile RAM.

The usual DNS caching hierarchy should mitigate this.  In particular for popular CDNs, a client will typically use the same handful of IPs for lots of unrelated traffic, thus getting the ESNI records in its local cache.\r\n\r\n- P2: VM hosting/Physical hosting/connectivity providers not granting PTR name assignment control to IP address customers will cause the same problems as for other protocols (such as mail) and should thus be under the same or greater pressure to add that service.  However since the greatest ESNI benefit is with IPs shared among many unrelated domains, and the operators of such IPs typically have full IP space ownership or the leverage to get PTR records where normal customers cannnot, the effect on ESNI deployment should be limited.\r\n\r\n- P3: This may or may not make it easier to do spoofing attacks, as an MitM attacker can spoof DNS responses either for the A/AAAA records of a target query domain (pointing to servers entirely under the attackers control, including legitimate ESNI records for that server) OR spoof the ESNI records of a server address for which the attacker has obtained traffic intercept ability.

The key part is making ESNI a server property rather than an origin property, bypassing most of the issues with configuring each of the non-controversial origin domains that are just used as cover traffic.  Hard part is finding a hello content that doesn't stick out by using any values specific to using a controversial domain.  Per origin ESNI would stick out as most origins would feel pressured to not actively join the pool, while having to do something difficult or even pricey to stay out of the pool would be less easy to encourage via generic mass pressure.\r\n\r\nFor the following approaches compare to a normal first TLS connection:\r\n  Round 1: DNS query for A and DNS query for AAAA (happy eyeballs)\r\n  Round 2: TCP SYN\r\n  Round 3: TLS Handshake round 1\r\n\r\nWith the PTR based approach the parallelizing would go like this for first contact (later contacts benefit from DNS caching):\r\n\r\nRound 1: DNS query for A and DNS query for AAAA (happy eyeballs)\r\nRound 2: TCP SYN, DNS query for PTR and DNS query for ESNI keys directly in i*.arpa\r\nRound 3: DNS query for ESNI keys at PTR name (perhaps cached at nearby resolver).\r\n    This round is done only if\r\n     A: no ESNI record (not even an empty one) returned in round 2 AND\r\n     B: PTR name returned and contains the substring \"esni.\"  For example \r\n          example x1234.cdn.esni.example.net or x1234esni.example.net would cause queries of\r\n          _esni.example x1234.cdn.esni.example.net or _esni.x1234esni.example.net\r\nRound 4: TLS Handshake round 1\r\n\r\nRule 3 B would require ESNI client facing servers without ability to add arbitrary reverse records to at least be able to choose a PTR name of the magic form.  Note that the magic form contains no underscore but will only cost an extra DNS lookup returning NXDOMAIN if a non-ESNI server has that name form by chance.  The rule may require further refinement to deal with common provider practices.\r\n\r\nOne technique requiring less round trips than a full HTTP REST API would be to use a clever sequence of TLS extensions, signalling suites etc. to do everything in the TLS layer at the cost of extra TCP round trips compared to the current draft.\r\n\r\nA hybrid approach could go like this (first contact):\r\n\r\n  Round 1: DNS query for A and DNS query for AAAA (happy eyeballs)\r\n  Round 2: TCP SYN, DNS query for _esni.$reverseip.arpa\r\n\r\nIf _esni returned with \"no\" record:\r\n  Round 3: TLS Hello with the signalling suite and normal SNI, server responds normally\r\n\r\nIf _esni returned with key:\r\n   Round 3: TLS hello with ESNI as per draft-02\r\n\r\nIf _esni returned with \"ask\" record:\r\n   Round 3: TCP hello with invalid right-size data in ESNI extension, server sends keys in encrypted ESNI response.\r\n   Round 4: Send new hello with real ESNI extension inside encrypted stream, server forwards to origin server, once encrypted by origin server, client-side server drops the outer encryption and forwards remaining packets unchanged.\r\n\r\nIf no _esni record returned from DNS, server is actually ESNI:\r\n  Round 3: TLS Hello with a signalling suite and no SNI or ESNI, server sends keys in encrypted ESNI response.  In parallel a new TCP SYN.\r\n  Round 4: Send new hello with real ESNI extension inside encrypted stream, server forwards to origin server, once encryption activated by origin server, client-side server drops the outer encryption and forwards remaining packets unchanged.\r\n (Second TCP connection may be used or closed)\r\n\r\nIf no _esni record returned from DNS, server is not ESNI and has a default certificate matching desired SNI:\r\n  Round 3: TLS Hello with a signalling suite and no SNI or ESNI, server server responds normally using its default certificate, client uses the connection.  In parallel a new TCP SYN.\r\n (Second TCP connection may be used or closed)\r\n\r\nIf no _esni record returned from DNS, server is not ESNI and has a default certificate not matching desired SNI:\r\n  Round 3: TLS Hello with a signalling suite and no SNI or ESNI, server server responds normally using its default certificate, client aborts.  In parallel a new TCP SYN.\r\n  Round 4: TLS Hello with the signalling suite and normal SNI, server responds normally.

Looking forward a few decades, there is little or no assurance that SHA-256 won't be in a similar situation.  In contrast the error detection abilities of CRC-32 (the only purpose it has in this place) has been proven mathematically, has survived for much much longer and is much faster to run before deciding if the cryptographic calculations are needed at all.

Everyone works hard to remove SHA-256 from their cryptographic applications, or at least establish onerous review procedures to ensure any remaining SHA-256 invocation is not a security problem.\r\n\r\n3. ESNI using SHA-256 for a non-cryptographic purpose will then become a very real practical liability, as every implementation will need to make excuses and audit documents just to prove they are not really using SHA-256 for anything risky.\r\n\r\nIf in contrast, ESNI used something non-cryptographic, like CRC-32 or the TCP checksum algorithm, this step 3 of the problem wouldn't happen.  Of the commonly implemented short checksums, CRC-32 is the only one optimized for detecting accidental data corruption, while the other are optimized for tiny speed margins at the cost of less effective detection.\r\n\r\nAs for CRC-32 being available in ESNI implementations, this is likely to be present already because it is used in gzip HTTP compression, but standard CRC-32 may be available for many other reasons.

However the server MAY obscure any structure in the numbering in any convenient manner.

The record_digest field and its calculation is removed, thus reducing the size of the ESNI extension.\r\n\r\n3. In ESNIContents, just use the full record instead of hashing it separately.

This avoids this odd situation we have here where ESNI wants to be the root of the tree, to the exclusion of everyone else who may wish to correlate data with A/AAAA.\r\n\r\nA nuisance here: we do want to avoid the client having to ask for all of A, AAAA, ESNI, *and* BUNDLE.

      "body": "The draft has provisions for GREASE ESNI extensions, per \"Do not stick out\". However, this is not very effective if an attacker can distinguish a GREASE ESNI extension from a real one.\r\n\r\n#154 tried to address this, but it doesn't work if the (public) ESNI record is known. There's also a simpler attack: replay the ClientHello with one byte of ciphertext corrupted. ESNI currently distinguishes key mismatch from decrypt failure, with the latter resulting in an alert. We can fix that by saying decrypt failure should behave like key mismatch. This still leaves record_digest.\r\n\r\nThe natural fix is to drop record_digest in favor of trial decryption. The cost is the server must perform a DH operation per known key. The number of keys the server needs depends on its DNS TTLs and key rotation. (I think it's 1 + ceil(dns_ttl / time_between_rotation), plus some leeway[*].)\r\n\r\nInstead, we can keep a key name, but make the space dense. Suppose we replace it with a B-bit \"key phase\". The server picks a random starting key phase. Then, each time it rotates the keys, it increments the phase, with wraparound. The server then gets 2<sup>B</sup> keys for free. If it needs more, it still needs trial decryption but gains a 2<sup>B</sup> multiplicative factor in the cost. On the flip side, an individual GREASE extension with a random key phase has a 1/2<sup>B</sup> chance of colliding with a particular ESNI key.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure we actually need that many live keys, so B = 2 is probably plenty. Or even B = 1 if we say you should just rotate slower than your DNS TTL.\r\n\r\n[*] Note the robustness mechanism means that server doesn't need to cover _all_ clients with stale keys. The retry is expensive, so the server still needs to cover _almost all_ of them, but it can cut off the long tail.",

First, it's public information whether a given server supports ECHO, so if an attacker wants to know that, it can mostly just ask [there is some complexity around getting candidate names, but note that you can always get the public name from the SNI value and any real attacker will see a lot of non-ECHO traffic and so will know a bunch of SNI values].\r\n\r\nWhat's not public information is whether a given *connection* uses ECHO. The attacker might not know this either because:\r\n\r\n1. It knows that the server is ECHO-supporting.\r\n1. It has a limited view of just the connection and isn't willing to do do the work of trying to determine if the server is ECHO-supporting.\r\n\r\nIn case (1) I would also expect that the attacker is not going to go to the trouble of doing probe connections, as determining if the server is ECHO supporting is easier. This leaves us with the case where the attacker knows that the server is ECHO supporting and that the client *knows* about ECHO (otherwise it couldn't generate GREASE) but doesn't know if the client is actually doing ECHO. Do we expect there to be a lot of clients like this? Why not just do ECHO?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Otherwise, it becomes very simple to inject a false record pointing to a compromised public server, and then track clients. At a minimum, if we expect the hidden servers to use CNAME, we should explain how to use DNSSEC to secure that.\r\n\r\nApart from DNSSEC, the other feature that we want is the support for multiple public servers, in case one of them is blocked. I don't think that CNAME can do that. In practice, the simplest way will be to have multiple ESNI records listed directly in the context of the hidden server. That works, and doing DNSSEC is straightforward. But it implies replication of the public server ESNI record in many places, which brings in the issues of managing replication.",

The issue as written isn't crisp :-) What we require, among possibly other things that I didn't write down, is that the information and authentication context for a ticket is indistinguishable across all tickets possible for a given set of servers. So in the example you describe, if a client gets a ticket without authenticating from one server and then resumes it to a different server that normally would require authentication, then the ticket must record whether authentication took place. And storing that bit should not reveal information about the name.\r\n\r\n(I was just aiming to make a note of this so I didn't forget it later. There's probably other things to consider, too. I don't claim this is complete as written!)\r\n\r\n> Is the motivation is various attacks around seeing if the server accepts a ticket in various contexts? \r\n\r\nYep!

This would provide excellent support for peer-to-peer applications for protocols that use `user@domain.name` identities and whose design can work peer-to-peer.\r\n\r\nThere are [TLS relays using SNI](https://github.com/dlundquist/sniproxy) that need no knowledge about the content of the TLS stream, so they are no men in the middle.  With user names added into ESNI, it would be possible to do similar things with registered users; [SIP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261) springs to mind as an example, because phones/terminals `REGISTER` [to a domain's server](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261#section-10.3) that subsequently [relays](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3261#page-12) `INVITE` and other messages between them but is effectively a MITM, which can modify traffic and tap [SDP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566)-transmitted [keys](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566#section-5.12) and [communication end points](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4566#section-4.1).\r\n\r\nThe general story is of course that end-to-end encryption is better than hop-by-hop encryption, as in current uses of TLS.  Peers representing users that register with an intermediate server sound like a good opportunity to be doing that.  All that is required is a way of deciding where to forward TLS traffic, without changing its contents.  ESNI comes really close to that goal (if it adds user names).",

While this was ESNI rather than ECHO, the reasoning was that the DNS server learns the hostname anyway, and can always drop ESNI records. The latter still holds for ECHO. The former... I'm not sure. Over in browser land, I really only care about the hostname, but there are probably other scenarios.",

There is a minor efficiency benefit in terms of the number of octets published in the DNS, but there is a lot of additional complexity in terms of code, and if nobody really publishes multiple public keys in one RR value, then that code is likely where we'll find CVEs. Reducing down to one public key per RR value also reduces the complexity when writing code to create/publish RRs.\r\n\r\nI think we have to support multiple RR values, because that's how the DNS works, and so the one to drop is the multiple public keys in one ECHOConfigs.

There are multiple ECHOConfig values in a single ECHOConfigs, which came from https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/pull/200. (Gosh, that was a terrible name. My bad. Maybe we should rename it?) I think the rationale there still holds? The problem is that an HTTPSSVC RR implies transport-level decisions, while not every ECHOConfig can be consumed by your TLS logic. Folding them together means transport connect needs to be aware of the exact ECHO capabilities. For instance, the origin could advertise:\r\n\r\n* route1.example.com echo=ECHOv1\r\n* route2.example.com echo=ECHOv2\r\n\r\nThe logic picking HTTPSSVC routes no longer gets a free choice. It must be aware of the TLS layer's capabilities (down to mandatory extensions and HPKE code points). ECHOConfigs means the expectation is:\r\n\r\n* route1.example.com echo={ECHOv1,ECHOv2}\r\n* route2.example.com echo={ECHOv2,ECHOv2}\r\n\r\nNow you pick a route freely and pass the entire opaque ECHO blob to TLS to interpret. Of course, one could still advertise:\r\n\r\n* route1.example.com echo={ECHOv1}\r\n* route2.example.com echo={ECHOv2}\r\n\r\nBut you're no longer forced to explode it out like that, so we can say an ECHOv1-only client that happens to pick route2 can act as if route1 didn't exist. I.e. we set an expectation that all your routes must be equally capable. (Just as we have that expectation elsewhere. If route1 only speaks TLS 1.0, you're not getting TLS's downgrade protection because the attacker can always redirect you to the less secure config.)",

In particular, we've landed #287, which changes the server behavior so that it provides an explicit signal of ECH acceptance in its SH. Hence, no more trial decryption. I'm wondering if your question still applies?\r\n\r\nI believe what to do in case of HRR is well-specified at this point. There is no such ECH accdeptance signal provided in the HRR, so to determine if ECH was accepted, the client must wait until the SH. Until that point, the client needs to compute two transcripts in parallel: one assuming the ClientHelloOuter was used, and another assuming the ClientHelloInner was used.",

If the client has different HRR-relevant preferences (key share and cipher suite) between CHInner and CHOuter, I believe HRR is still a mess because the HRR message doesn't contain a signal for whether ECH was accepted. Though I suppose it is a little less complex now that you don't need to go as far as trial decrypting. Different HRR-relevant preferences means the HRR may be good for one ClientHello but not the other, yet the client needs to manage that state and defer the actual error-handling to when ECH acceptance is known. An option where the HRR message included an ECH acceptance signal would close this, but then we have sticking out woes.\r\n\r\nThe draft touches on this, but somewhat vaguely.\r\nhttps://tlswg.org/draft-ietf-tls-esni/draft-ietf-tls-esni.html#section-6.3.3-1\r\n\r\nWe've been intending that our implementation would always match inner and outer preferences for HRR-sensitive fields, to avoid this case.

It is not possible to compute a CHOuter, but you have to, so I guess you send something garbage? But you still need to make a note to raise an error if you see SH which claims it rejected ECH.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge mess. The client can avoid this mess by always matching key_shares, supported_groups, and cipher_suites between CHInner and CHOuter. That means it can process HRR without knowing which CH to use.

This nonce ensures that the server's encrypted Certificate can only be read by the entity which sent this ClientHello.\r\n2. Since servers process either ClientHelloInner or ClientHelloOuter, and ClientHelloInner contains an HPKE-derived nonce, it is not possible for an attacker to \"cut and paste\" the ECH value in a different Client Hello and learn information from ClientHelloInner. This is because the attacker lacks access to the HPKE-derived nonce used to derive the handshake secrets.\r\n3. Client Reaction Attack Mitigation ... The \"ech_nonce\" extension in the inner ClientHello prevents this attack. In particular, since the attacker does not have access to this value, it cannot produce the right transcript and handshake keys needed for encrypting the Certificate message. Thus, the client will fail to decrypt the Certificate and abort the connection.\r\n\r\nThese rationales are all subtly different, and having read them all, I still don't understand why the nonce is necessary, when the server_handshake_traffic_secret already depends on the inner client random, which is not known to the attacker.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate some more explanation on this point.  It also might make sense to move these rationales up into the ech_nonce section, or add forward references to them there.",

The list of\r\n   outer_extensions include those which were removed from\r\n   ClientHelloInner, in the order in which they were removed.\r\n\r\nI interpret this as the following procedure:\r\n```python\r\n   outer_extensions = OuterExtensions()\r\n   for extension in client_hello_inner.extensions:\r\n      if extension in client_hello_outer.extensions and too_big(extension.get_payload()):\r\n          outer_extensions.append(extension.get_type())\r\n          client_hello_inner.remove(extension)\r\n   client_hello_inner.extensions.append(outer_extensions)\r\n```\r\nIs it clear what I mean here?

If this isn't a problem, then I guess we're good here. It's worth flagging this, however (from RFC 8446): \r\n\r\n>    When multiple extensions of different types are present, the\r\n   extensions MAY appear in any order, with the exception of\r\n   \"pre_shared_key\" (Section 4.2.11) which MUST be the last extension in\r\n   the ClientHello (but can appear anywhere in the ServerHello\r\n   extensions block).\r\n\r\nAn order-preserving alternative would be something like this:\r\n```python\r\n   # compress\r\n   for extension in client_hello_inner.extensions:\r\n      if extension in client_hello_outer.extensions and too_big(extension.get_payload()):\r\n          extension.drop_payload() # Send extension with empty payload.\r\n   \r\n   # decompress\r\n   for inner in client_hello_inner.extensions:\r\n       if inner.get_payload() == None\r\n            for outer in client_hello_outer.extensions:\r\n                 if outer.get_type() == inner.get_type():\r\n                      inner.set_payload(outer.get_payload())\r\n```\r\nThis would have the added benefit of not needing to define an additional extension point.",

      "body": "ECH currently uses two different kinds of padding. The encrypted ClientHello is padded with the padding extension, while the server response is padded with TLS 1.3 record layer padding.\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-07#section-7.1\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-07#section-7.2\r\n\r\nUsing record-level padding in TLS over TCP is relatively straightforward as it\u2019s ordered. However DTLS and QUIC have their own record layers, with retransmission logic. Properly hiding some length then requires that packet loss and retransmission logic track and retransmit padding as if it were integrated into the byte stream.\r\n\r\nIn the case of QUIC, when a QUIC packet is determined to be lost, it is not retransmitted whole; instead information carried in the frames in lost packets might be sent again in new frames (draft-ietf-quic-transport, section 13.3). That same section states that PADDING frames do not need to be retransmitted. If ECH in QUIC relies on QUIC transport layer padding, that would need to be changed, and implementations would need to track how much adding is associated with CRYPTO frame data for retransmission.\r\n\r\nQUIC additionally needs the padding size communicated across API boundaries between the TLS and QUIC implementations. It\u2019s likely that everyone\u2019s first pass at the API will omit this, only to need to add an extra parameter (API change) later when they implement ECH.\r\n\r\nThis seems a somewhat general issue between padding at reliably- and unreliably-transmitted layers of the stack. HTTP/3 has something analogous (though carried in slightly frames). That draft actually discusses two options for padding and calls out the relation to packet loss:\r\n\r\n> Where HTTP/2 employs PADDING frames and Padding fields in other frames to make a connection more resistant to traffic analysis, HTTP/3 can either rely on transport-layer padding or employ the reserved frame and stream types discussed in Section 7.2.8 and Section 6.2.3. These methods of padding produce different results in terms of the granularity of padding, how padding is arranged in relation to the information that is being protected, whether padding is applied in the case of packet loss, and how an implementation might control padding. Redundant padding could even be counterproductive.\r\n\r\nhttps://quicwg.org/base-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-http.html#name-padding-and-traffic-analysi\r\n\r\nShould we match that precedent and move the padding into the handshake itself? That would make it apply to DTLS and QUIC transparently. If we do, a couple possibilities to start with:\r\n\r\n* Say that ECH implementations must tolerate unsolicited padding extensions and inject those into various messages. This is a goofy around messages without extensions (CertificateVerify), or messages with multiple extension blocks (Certificate), but as long as there is an extension block _somewhere_ in each padded flight, it's probably possible to fudge it.\r\n* Say that ECH adds a new kind of Padding handshake message, which the sender can incorporate into the handshake as needed, and the receiver ignores.\r\n\r\nIf we leave ECH as-is, it seems to me QUIC (both spec and implementations) needs some changes to track padding across retransmission.",

The receiver path is trivial, and avoiding per-message semantics for adding padding (or not, if the extension isn't supported) seems easier.

That is, it can pad a fully-formed CH, rather than only part of a CH.)",

In case of QUIC, we also have to make sure that PING frame would be used when the only thing that has to be retransmitted is padding, because not sending an ack-eliciting packet would reveal to a passive observer that it was padding only.",

The extension compresses the entire Certificate message, so any padding messages inside the payload would get compressed away.\r\n\r\nWe could still fudge this by computing how much padding would be needed ahead of time and then adjusting the padding in EncryptedExtensions (same flight and all), but this is getting pretty silly. :-)\r\n\r\nAn aside since this comes up alot: ECH and certificate compression are perfectly compatible. Rather than padding up to `max(len(cert) for cert in anonymity_set)`, you pad the compressed cert up to `max(len(compress(cert)) for cert in anonymity_set)`. The key observation is that, assuming compression support is uniform across the anonymity set, *whether* you compressed is not sensitive, only *what* you compressed.\r\n\r\n> New messages cost more (than I'd like).\r\n\r\nHuh, I'd actually seen the extension as more annoying, since we'd need to add quirks to the unsolicited extensions rule. Is the issue for you all the state machine integration or something else?

      "body": "In the current spec, the server provides no indication of whether the inner or outer ClientHello (CH) was used. This means the client must do trial decryption to make this determination, which creates complexity and potentially raises security concerns. As such, it would be useful to explore possible alternatives. In order to drive the discussion, I'll provide a few simple alternatives below, which we can refine as folks provide feedback. (The current spec, draft-07, is listed as option (0) for comparison.)\r\n\r\nBesides implementation complexity, one of our design considerations is ensuring that middleboxes don't ossify on ECH. As such, indication of ECH usage should \"stick out\" (see [draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption, Sec 3.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-sni-encryption-09#section-3.4)) as little as possible.\r\n\r\nFor our purposes, \"do not stick out\" means a middlebox who observes connections between the client and the client-facing server can't distinguish between real ECH and \"dummy\" ECH (i.e., a \"GREASEd\" extension, as described [Section 7.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-07#section-7.4)). We assume the middlebox doesn't know the ECH configuration or the public-facing name. (Note that this rules out adversaries such as the GFW, which can actively probe to discover this information.)\r\n\r\n## Option (0): Do not indicate usage\r\n**Protocol flow:**\r\n* **On input of the client's outer CH.** If the server accepts `ech` (i.e., `encrypted_client_hello`), it uses the inner CH; and if the server rejects or does not support ECH, then it uses the outer CH. It proceeds with the handshake as normal, except that in case of rejection, it sends an `ech` extension in its EE with the updated `ech` configuration.\r\n* **On input of the server's SH, EE, \u2026, Finished.** The client determines whether the inner CH or outer CH was used by computing the decryption key for each scenario and attempting to decrypt EE. It then proceeds with the handshake as usual, updating its `ech` configuration if applicable.\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n* Sticks out the least.\r\n* Is the least complex for servers to implement (same for Option (2)).\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n* Is the most complex for clients to implement.\r\n\r\n**Spec changes:** None.\r\n\r\n## Option (1): Publicly indicate acceptance\r\n**Protocol flow:**\r\n* **On input of the client's outer CH.** If the server accepts `ech`, it uses the inner CH; and if the server rejects or does not support `ech`, then it uses the outer CH. If the server accepts, then it adds an empty `ech` extension to its SH; if the server rejects, then it adds an `ech` extension to its EE with the updated `ech` configuration; and If the server doesn't support `ech`, then it proceeds as normal.\r\n* **On input of the server's SH, EE, \u2026, Finished.** If the SH has the `ech` extension, then the client proceeds as normal, assuming the inner CH was used; otherwise, the client proceeds as if the outer CH was used, updating its `ech` configuration if applicable.\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n* Is the least complex for clients to implement.\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n* Breaks Split Mode: the backend server must indicate acceptance in its SH but does not know whether the client-facing server accepted or not. (We could ameliorate this problem by adding an indication of acceptance to the inner CH.)\r\n* Sticks out the most. (See Option (3).)\r\n\r\n**Spec changes:** Semantics of the `ech`  extension changes; changes are needed to accommodate \"Split Mode\".\r\n\r\n## Option (2): Publicly indicate rejection\r\n\r\n**Protocol flow**:\r\n*  **On input of the client's outer CH.** If the server accepts `ech`, it uses the inner CH; and if the server rejects or does not support `ech`, then it uses the outer CH. If the server accepts or does not support `ech`, then it proceeds as usual; and if the server rejects, then it adds an `ech` extension to its SH with the updated `ech` configuration.\r\n*  **On input of the server's SH, EE, \u2026, Finished.** If the SH has the `ech` extension, then the client proceeds as if the outer CH was used and updates its `ech` configuration; otherwise, the client proceeds as if the inner CH was used. Decryption failure indicates either that the server does not support `ech` (i.e., outer CH was used) or the connection is under attack.\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n* Is the least complex for the server to implement (same as Option (0)).\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n* Sticks out, but only on rejection.\r\n* Complicates deployment: if the client offers `ech` to a server that has turned off support for the extension, then the connection will fail hard, as the client assumes lack of signal means that `ech` was accepted. (We could ameliorate this problem, at the cost of added complexity on the client side implementation.)\r\n\r\n**Spec changes:** Semantics of the `ech` extension changes; `ech` configuration update is sent in the clear. (We could avoid this by sending the new configuration in a new extension in the EE.)\r\n\r\n## Option (3): Privately indicate acceptance\r\nIt may be worth considering an alternative to Option (1) that doesn't stick out as much. Namely, it's possible to make `ech` acceptance in the SH indistinguishable from `ech` rejection.",

In particular, the status quo (option (0)) requires the handshake and record layer coordinate to implement the trial decryption. This would need to happen separately in TLS, DTLS, and QUIC.\r\n\r\nThis is especially a nuisance for QUIC as it will typically cross the TLS library\u2019s public API. TLS must configure two different keys for QUIC, then QUIC must do some trial decryption, and it must report back to TLS which keys were used. Public APIs and changes in them require coordination across groups, so ideally such interfaces stay as simple as possible. As in #264, I think an option that stays entirely in the handshake would apply to QUIC better.",

The indication is a pseudorandom value output by the HPKE state.

Its output can be treated as pseudorandom, e.g., `context.Export(\"tls13-ech-hrr-key', 16)` in Section 7.1 is treated as being indistinguishable from random.\r\n\r\n**Protocol flow:**\r\n* **On input of the client's outer CH.** If the server accepts `ech`, it uses the inner CH; and if the server rejects or does not support `ech`, then it uses the outer CH. If the server accepts, then it adds an `ech` extension to its SH with `context.Export(\"tls13-ech-accept\", 16)` as the value; if the server rejects, then it adds an `ech` extension to its SH with a random, 16-byte string and an \"ech_retry\" extension to its EE with the updated `ech` configuration; if the server does not support `ech`, then it proceeds as normal, but MAY mimic `ech` rejection.\r\n* **On input of the server's SH, EE, \u2026, Finished.** If the SH has the `ech` extension with payload `context.Export(\"tls13-ech-accept\", 16)`, then it proceeds as if the inner CH was used; otherwise it proceeds as if the outer CH was used, updating its `ech` configuration if applicable.\r\n\r\n**Pros**\r\n* Similar to Option (1)\r\n\r\n**Cons**\r\n* Similar to Option (1), but doesn't stick out as much.

Also, there would be other ways to determine if a large-scale server supports ECH (note: ECH is about hiding a tree in the wood, so it's about the cost of finding such woods).

If the local network is normally used to access a small set of services, and none of them support ECH yet, then this will appear to work fine, perhaps for years.

It's not explicitly connected to ECH, which I think makes it more likely to be implemented and less likely to be blocked.  In principle, it could be used for any future situation where the cryptographic context is ambiguous.  It would also give clients the option to use trial decryption in TLS/TCP, and avoid it for QUIC.  (Support would be mandatory for ECH and QUIC servers, but optional for clients.)",

This wouldn't work in situations where a third party doesn't have any motivation to implement ECH-related extensions, a tough loss, but not fatal. The problem here is that the combination of the presence of the client extension (signaling client support for ECH) and the server extensions (signaling server support for ECH) is going to make ECH-enabled traffic stick out from non-ECH-enabled traffic, even if dummy ECHs are sent 100% of the time from supporting clients.

The TLS implementation MUST NOT\r\n   report such connections as successful to the application. It\r\n   additionally MUST ignore all session tickets and session IDs\r\n   presented by the server. These connections are only used to trigger\r\n   retries, as described in {{handle-server-response}}. This may be\r\n   implemented, for instance, by reporting a failed connection with a\r\n   dedicated error code.\r\n\r\nIOW, we don't try to recover for cases where the client-facing server\r\nhas just forgotten about ECH but rather where it has forgotten the\r\nECH key. So, hard fail is actually not a problem here. I'm similarly\r\nnot worried about signaling that the server is ECH-capable (especially\r\nin this case where it's actually not). So, I think my ? under \"Easy\r\nClient Impl\" turns out to be a Y.\r\n\r\nWith that said, I do find Option 3 aesthetically cleaner, though I'd\r\nstruggle a bit to explain why and there is an obvious appeal to not\r\nhaving *any* public signaling in terms of being able to analyze it,\r\nthough I'm not sure how strong an argument that is. I'm also not\r\nthat worried about the sticking out piece, as I would expect that\r\nwe can rapidly make a lot of servers accept and pretend do respond\r\nto grease-ECH -- which we would want to do in any case.\r\n\r\nI'd like to hear from some other people about why they prefer (3) to (2)\r\nand whether there is some split mode-compatible variant of (3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

The essence of the problem is that an ECH server that advertised a configuration in the past must support ECH for as long as that configuration is valid. What are some \"bad\" events that may lead to this contract being violated?\r\n\r\n- *The ECH secret key has been compromised, so the service needs to be shut off until a new key is rolled.* In the meantime, the service can explicitly reject ECH without providing a new configuration. The client would take this as a signal of ECH being disabled by the server.\r\n- *A bug is found somewhere in the TLS stack, and the quick fix is to revert to a point before the ECH code was committed.* This is definitely a risk, but I wonder if there are ways to mitigate it. For example, if the configuration is valid for the next hour, say, then we must delay the rollback until the hour has lapsed. Alternatively, we can roll-back right away, and when the client aborts because of decryption failure, it might make a DNS query to see if ECH support has been turned off.",

One hopes that pipeline is already built out and regularly exercised by routine key rotation.)\r\n\r\nI'm worried about the second one, but I think the characterization is too simple. TLS implementations are part of a complex system, both within the service and on the internet as a whole. Complex systems break unpredictably. Maybe it's a TLS bug. Maybe ECH inadvertently broke some assumption in some other part of the stack. Maybe some large client had a bug that only triggered due here to some quirk of the server. Maybe some printer happened to be [using the code point](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/i9blmvG2BEPf1s1OJkenHknRw9c/) and now breaks. Maybe it had nothing to do with TLS at all, but some other concurrent server change broke and the entire release needs to be rolled back.\r\n\r\nAnything which interferes with the default response (rollback to a known good configuration) is expensive and risky. This risk needs to be communicated across a long game of telephone from...\r\n\r\n* the people who wrote the ECH to spec, to...\r\n* the people who implemented it in the TLS library, to...\r\n* the people who integrated it into some server software, to...\r\n* the people who perhaps packaged the server software into some OS release, to...\r\n* the people who perhaps shipped the OS release in some server appliance, to...\r\n* the people who manage the rollout of the change in some deployment, to...\r\n* the people who noticed a failure in a faraway system and are trying to mitigate it\r\n\r\nThis is not practical, especially if we want ECH to be widely adopted.\r\n\r\nTo the alternatives you list, when things go wrong, the priority is to get the service working again. Leaving it broken until the ECH config expires is thus not great. Moreover, expiry itself is a property of a complex system (DNS), so it may not be clear when it actually expires.

As @grittygrease pointed out, we have largely ignored a potentially important \"don't stick out\" consideration. The goal of (3) is to make connections from a real ECH client to an ECH server look like connections from a dummy ECH client (i.e., one that sends a GREASEd extension) to an ECH server. A property that (0,2) have that (1,3) don't is that connections from a real ECH client to an ECH server look like connections from a dummy ECH client to a non-ECH server. In other words, options (1,3) don't provide covertext for non-ECH servers, whereas (0,2) do. (ECH rejection sticks out for (2), but the happy path doesn't.)

If clients still need to implement trial decryption for one case, however unlikely, we're still paying for it and there's no point in building a separate thing. How common a codepath is affects performance considerations, but not complexity considerations. The issue with trial decryption is complexity, not performance. (Trial decryption also breaks some in-place decryption strategies, so there can be a performance concern too, but it's just one record so I'm not concerned about that.)\r\n\r\n> A property that (0,2) have that (1,3) don't is that connections from a real ECH client to an ECH server look like connections from a dummy ECH client to a non-ECH server.

Do we regard this as a risk to deployment?\r\n\r\nRight, I think this is the ServerHello.random vs. new extension question for (3). Sticking the indicator in ServerHello.random makes the full cross product of {ECH-client, GREASE-client} x {ECH-server, non-ECH-server} look the same, provided the server supports TLS 1.3. This is nice, but it's a weird one-off trick we can't do again. Sticking the indicator in a new extension also makes the same cross product look the same, provided the server supports TLS 1.3 *and* has been updated to send this extension. It can send this extension independent of ECH support, but it's not a thing anyone does today because the extension doesn't exist, so the deployment curve will be different.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, (2) is missing coverage. It makes the following tuples look the same: (ECH-client, ECH-server), (ECH-client, non-ECH-server), (GREASE-client, non-ECH-server). It misses (GREASE-client, ECH-server). In particular, clients may be ECH-capable (and thus know to send GREASE extensions) but not configured with a DoH resolver and unable to get HTTPS records over Do53 (either due to cleartext problems or ossification).",

(At the time this text was written, we hadn't even figured out the multi-CDN story.)\r\n* Even if the retry keys contained a full SVCB record, one CDN won't know the config of the other CDN, so it ends up being a CDN pin, which seems awkward.\r\n* Any cache for subsequent connections needs to deal with the larger lifetimes necessary for effectiveness (see https://github.com/MikeBishop/dns-alt-svc/issues/105)\r\n\r\nGiven all that mess, I omitted it from the PR when proposing this mechanism and figured we'd think about these issues later if the WG wanted to pursue a non-DNS flow.",

The open issue for this change is security.\r\n\r\n@chris-wood and I reached out to a variety of people who have worked on security proofs of TLS 1.3 to see how this change might impact their analysis. While this change is significant enough to requires generating fresh proofs, no one expects it to lead to an attack if the confirmation string is sufficiently short. The current proposal uses the last 8 bytes of the SH.random, which leaves 24 bytes of entropy to ensure uniqueness of the session id. I added discussion of this point to the PR... it would be helpful to get more eyes on this.",

Currently our requirement is that a **passive observer**, who doesn't know the configuration, is unable distinguish real ECH usage from the \"cover traffic\" provided by clients who \"GREASE\" the ECH extension. The attackers mentioned so far are **active** and may know the config. So let's start here: do we anticipate an attacker this powerful? So far we've mostly been talking about \"don't stick out\" in terms of dumb middleboxes that we don't want ossifying on our extension. The current threat model captures this pretty well, I think. If we want to go for something stronger, then we clearly need to re-think the design of #287 (or decide we shouldn't do it).\r\n\r\nSomething to keep in mind is that indistinguishability of the \"real\" protocol from some \"cover\" protocol is a property that TLS was never designed to have. It seems to me that the task of endowing TLS with some sort of stegonagraphic security property goes way beyond this one extension. It's an interesting and valuable goal, but one that should be addressed in a more general way.\r\n\r\nFor ECH, I think we should focus our efforts on coming up with a design that we feel we can deploy today, and iterate and re-deploy as needed.",

Let's consider the \"replay protection\" properties of the current proposals. Suppose the attacker wants to learn if a client offered ECH, so it replays the ClientHelloOuter to the server. Here are the proposals (please chime in if I got this wrong!)\r\n\r\n1. current proposal: `accept_confirmation = getrandom(8)`\r\n2. @ekr proposes: `accept_confirmation = Hash(ClientHelloInner.random)`\r\n3. @bemasc proposes: `accept_confirmation = Hash(ServerHello.random[0:24] + ClientHelloInner.random)`\r\n\r\nwhere `Hash` is something like `Expand(Extract( . , some_salt), some_info, 8)`. (Though since the ikm is a random string, I think it would suffice to just call `Extract( . , some_info, 8)`.)\r\n\r\nNeither 1 nor 2 mitigates the attack, but 3 does. All options \"stick out\" the same if the ClientHelloInner is known, e.g., if the adversary is on-path from the client-facing server to the backend server. \r\n\r\nIncidentally, proposals 2 and 3 are an improvement over 1 since we don't have to send an extension in the ClientHelloInner. On the down side, the backend server needs to know how to instantiate `Hash`, i.e., it needs to know the HPKE cipher suite. We could get around this by using the hash from the TLS cipher suite.",

Trial decryption generates complexity, especially in the QUIC mapping, but the result is unambiguous and hard to fool.

The hint introduces another failure mode, i.e. wrong hint value, and I believe it can be exploited. For protection, the code has to be almost as hard to fool as trial decryption.

Although, looking at ECHConfig again, the association between AEAD and KDF is a purely ECH-level construct. So we could choose to disassociate them and then flatten:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       struct {\r\n           opaque public_name<1..2^16-1>;\r\n\r\n           HpkePublicKey public_key;\r\n           HpkeKemId kem_id;\r\n           HpkeKdfId kdf_id;\r\n           HpkeAeadId aead_ids<2..2^16-2>;\r\n\r\n           uint16 maximum_name_length;\r\n           Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;\r\n       } ECHConfigContents;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow there's no multiplication.

If so, this is referred to as an \"ECH PSK\". Otherwise, it is a \"non-ECH PSK\". This may be implemented by adding a new field to client and server session states.\r\n\r\n> When offering an encrypted ClientHello, the client MUST NOT offer to resume any non-ECH PSKs.\r\n\r\n> If the server resumed a session or negotiated a session that did not use a certificate for authentication, the client MUST abort the connection with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. This case is invalid because {{send-ech}} requires the client to only offer ECH-established sessions, and {{server-behavior}} requires the server to decline ECH-established sessions if it did not accept ECH.\r\n\r\n> The server MUST ignore all PSK identities in the ClientHello which correspond to ECH PSKs. ECH PSKs offered by the client are associated with the ECH name. The server was unable to decrypt then ECH name, so it should not resume them when using the plaintext SNI name. This restriction allows a client to reject resumptions in {{auth-public-name}}.\r\n\r\n> If the server sends a NewSessionTicket message, the corresponding ECH PSK MUST be ignored by all other servers in the deployment when not negotiating ECH, including servers which do not implement this specification.\r\n\r\nThese rules date to before we started encrypting the entire ClientHello and were intended to avoid mixing up session resumptions between the public and private name, since the same pre_shared_key extension was used for both, and amount to saying implementations must add a boolean to their session state.\r\n\r\nNow that the public and private names correspond to different ClientHellos altogether, the client can (and should) only send inner name tickets in the inner ClientHello and outer name tickets in the outer ClientHello. (#270) I suspect that means we no longer need further ECH special cases here.",

In other words, will it ever be useful to send a PSK extension in the ClientHelloOuter? It seems to me that this feature is only meaningful to the intended backend server, and so should only appear in the ClientHelloInner.\r\n\r\nThe same question applies to all other extensions. If the client-facing server terminates the connection, then the only action the client will take is to close the connection. Hence, the only functionality we will ever need for the client<->client-facing server connection is to complete a full, server-authenticated handshake. If I were implementing the client, I would restrict the contents of the ClientHelloOuter to only those extensions that are necessary to implement this functionality. I wonder if it makes sense to enforce this in the spec. Something like: \"When offering the 'ech' extension, the client MAY include the following extensions in the ClientHelloOuter: 'supported_versions', 'server_name'. 'key_shares', 'signature_algorithms', [and so on]. It MUST NOT include any other extension.\"\r\n\r\nWhat are the downsides to doing something like this? I think the upside is that it simplifies the problem of deciding what to put in the ClientHelloInner versus the ClientHelloOuter. I suppose one downside is that it potentially sticks out a bit.",

(The difference between shared and split mode is not important for this logical distinction between \"client-facing server\" and \"backend server\".)\r\n\r\nSome more context on why rejection is not appropriate. Given a CH with the ECH extension, the server can act in some ways (based on Section 3.2):\r\n\r\n1. ECH not supported by client-facing server. Proceed as usual.\r\n2. \"ECH rejection\"\r\n   a. No ECHConfig was found for the given `config_digest`. The client-facing server rejects and sends a `retry_configs` extension.\r\n   b. A valid ECHConfig was found, but decryption fails. Server aborts with a `decrypt_error` alert. (Note an ambiguity on \"decryption failure\" - I filed #290 for that.)\r\n3. \"ECH acceptance\"\r\n  a. A valid ECHConfig was found, and the backend is authoritative for the decrypted SNI. Client-facing server accepts.\r\n  b. A valid ECHConfig was found, and the backend is not authoritative for the decrypted SNI. (This issue.)\r\n\r\nIn case (3b), rejecting as is done in (2a) is wrong because the next retried connection will fail similarly.\r\n\r\nIn the current specification, the decrypted CH is forwarded to the backend and is treated as \"ECH acceptance\". The backend could subsequently send an \"unrecognized_name\" alert instead of the Server Hello, send a default self-signed certificate, etc. Whether the backend is authoritative is invisible to the client-facing server.\r\n\r\nHowever if #283 gets implemented, ECH confirmation will be explicit and requires backend cooperation. This is not possible if the backend sends an alert before the Server Hello. Rejection on the other hand is also not valid for the reason mentioned before. Hence the explicit suggestion for an alert.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

(@dmcardle since we were talking about this recently.)\r\n\r\nThere's no real reason for the client to offer TLS 1.2 in the inner ClientHello, and it could send a potentially smaller ClientHello (fewer cipher suites, omit renegotiation_info, extended_master_secret, shorter supported_versions). One footnote is a shorter supported_versions is still more bytes than a compressed supported_versions, but I think the savings elsewhere exceed that. (At least for now. Maybe 10 years from now, there will be very few TLS 1.2 ciphers and very many post-TLS-1.2 versions before TLS 1.2 is gone??)\r\n\r\nI guess the other factor is it may also be more convenient for the client not to have juggle two different min_version values around in its ClientHello construction logic.

      "body": "We previously decided not to bind the outer ClientHello to the ECH decryption, because doing so is rather a hassle. We'd need something similar to the TLS 1.3 PSK binder mess, with the added complexity of ordering relative to the PSK binders themselves. Additionally, while the binding helps with some of the don't stick out properties, there were other attacks on distinguishability anyway. So, instead, we mitigated the inner ClientHello malleability with OuterExtensions.inner_digest and left the outer ClientHello unbound.\r\n\r\nHowever, we've since decided not to allow PSKs in the outer ClientHello. Perhaps we should revisit this. Suppose the AD parameter to the ECH decryption were the entire outer ClientHello, minus the ECH extension. I believe this means we no longer need OuterExtensions.inner_digest. That would give an immediate 33-byte savings. It would then unlock a further 32 byte savings by amending #312 to say:\r\n\r\n* Client always encodes an empty legacy_session_id in ECH plaintext.\r\n* Client-facing server copies outer legacy_session_id to inner ClientHello as part of decompression.\r\n\r\n(The reason we can't do this easily right now is that, if the inner ClientHello lacks outer_extension, nothing's authenticating legacy_session_id. Since the field in TLS 1.3 is all but ignored, it's \"obvious\" that the malleability doesn't matter, but it's nicer to not need to think about such things.)\r\n\r\nFrom looking at Chrome's ClientHellos and working through what we'd send (drop 1.2-only extensions, compress most), it looks like the inner ClientHello will be maybe 130-140 bytes, plus a padded server_name. The 65 bytes above would almost halve the overhead.\r\n\r\nIn some sense what's going on here is our 16-byte tag on the AEAD in the ECH ciphertext is going to waste. We didn't authenticate everything that goes into reconstructing the inner ClientHello (outer_extensions), so instead we authenticate another hash (OuterExtensions.inner_digest) and check that afterwards. (To that end, if we do this, we probably need to say the server MUST reject encrypted_client_hello showing up in outer_extensions, that way all inputs to decompression are authenticated. Equivalently, decompression is done relative to the ECH-extension-less AD input rather than the original outer ClientHello.)",

First off, suppose we don't merge something like #316. The current text says:\r\n\r\n> Note: if the inner and outer ClientHellos use different groups for\r\n> their key shares or differ in some other way, then the HelloRetryRequest may\t\r\n> actually be invalid for one or the other ClientHello, in which case a fresh\t\r\n> ClientHello MUST be generated, ignoring the instructions in HelloRetryRequest.\t\r\n> Otherwise, the usual rules for HelloRetryRequest processing apply\r\n\r\nThis means if you get a cookied HRR only good for ClientHelloInner, there's no requirement to stick the cookie in ClientHelloOuter! But now the client-facing server can't see the cookie, so it can't be stateless. It would seem like #316 fixes this, but now we have a more fundamental problem: whose cookie?\r\n\r\nSuppose the client-facing server wishes to handle HRR statelessly. It decrypts the first ClientHelloInner and forwards it to the backend server. If the backend server responds with HRR, the client-facing server must forward the HRR as-is, or the transcript breaks. But the client-facing server has no opportunity to bind its state (ech_hrr_key) into the HRR cookie. (Perhaps there isn't even one. If there is, it's encrypted with the backend server's key anyway. Either way, it's fixed now.)\r\n\r\nThe simplest solution to all this is to only support stateful client-facing servers in split mode, unless the client-facing and backend servers can coordinate enough to share one cookie. I don't know if that would satisfy everyone. I could imagine doing something horrific to HRR.cookie, akin to what we did to ServerHello.random, but that sounds really messy.",

In both this design and the status quo, the client-facing server needs to either be stateful or store *something* secret in the cookie. Right now it's ech_hrr_key. In this design it's the key/IV.

This use case makes me think it should.\r\n\r\nThe serialization doesn't need to be standard or anything. A TLS server might want to keep its cookie small by observing it doesn't need the exporter secret. But some guidance might be useful, sure.\r\n\r\n(The only thing that needs to consume the cookie is the server, who also produced it. Just as TLS doesn't (and shouldn't) specify session state serialization, yet every TLS implementation has a session state serialization.

      "body": "The primary \"don't stick out\" [RFC8744] consideration for ECH is to ensure that the new extension does not trigger middlebox misbehavior. To accomplish this, the draft specifies two protocol variants: in the \"real-ECH\" protocol the client offers the ECH extension, which is processed by the server; in the \"grease-ECH\" protocol, the client generates a dummy ECH extension, which is ignored or rejected by the server. Grease-ECH is designed to look enough like real-ECH so that middleboxes do not differentiate the latter from the former, the idea being that if grease-ECH can be deployed without triggering middlebox misbehavior, then real-ECH ought to be deployable, too.\r\n\r\nBut what do we mean when we say grease-ECH should \"look like\" real-ECH? In ECH-08 the stated goal is \"to hide, to some extent, **(a)** whether or not a specific server supports ECH and **(b)** whether or not ECH was accepted for a particular connection\" [ECH-08, [Sec.10.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-08#section-10.1)]. These goals are hard to meet. First, an attacker can violate **(a)** by simply running grease-ECH with the server to see if it returns retry configs. Second, there are a number of ways to distinguish real-ECH from grease-ECH, thereby violating **(b)**:\r\n1. @huitema's [client-reaction attack](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/EAeKCNq7JAFm8DFaoe2MwSslZTQ/).\r\n1. If the ECH config is known to the attacker, then it can use ClientECH.config_id to distinguish real-ECH from grease-ECH. \r\n1. The outer SNI must match ECHConfig.public_name. Hence, for connections to a given backend server, the outer SNI will be different in real-ECH than in grease-ECH.\r\n1. The client and server must negotiate TLS 1.3 when ECH is accepted, but may otherwise negotiate an earlier version. In particular, it is valid for a client to run grease-ECH but not indicate support for 1.3.\r\n1. PSK must not be offered in the outer CH in real-ECH, but may be offered in grease-ECH. In general, the set of extensions negotiated may depend on whether ECH was accepted.\r\n1. The client-facing server must not request client authentication when rejecting ECH, but the backend server may request client authentication when ECH was accepted.\r\n1. Whether or not an HRR message is issued by the server may depend on ECH acceptance.\r\n1. There are a few active distinguisher attacks that exploit the HRR codepath.\r\n\r\nSome of these distinguishers can be mitigated by careful implementation, while mitigating others would require changes to the specification. (E.g., #353.) However, it's unlikely that _all_ implementations will mitigate _all_ of these distinguishers. Moreover, future extensions are likely to change the shape of TLS in a way that leads to yet more distinguishers.\r\n\r\nGiven all of this, I wonder if indistinguishability (of real-ECH from grease-ECH) is the right way to think about this problem. It seems to me that it's stronger than strictly necessary, since the existence of a distinguisher does not necessarily imply that some feature of real-ECH will trigger middlebox misbehavior that would not otherwise be triggered by grease-ECH. For example, while the outer SNI might be a dead give away of likely ECH usage, this value is unlikely to impact middlebox behavior. Similarly, the absence of the PSK extension in real-ECH is unlikely to cause issues.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to enumerate the set of properties that impact middlebox behavior, then ensuring that middleboxes don't differentiate between real-ECH and grease-ECH may simply be a matter of ensuring that this set of properties does not vary. This approach would be roughly analogous to the design of \"Middlebox Compatibility Mode\" in TLS 1.3, which makes the handshake \"look like\" a particular mode of 1.2 that middleboxes are known to tolerate. Of course, a curious adversary (e.g., a censor) can easily distinguish between these, but experience suggests that middleboxes do not treat them differently.\r\n\r\nThis leaves us the daunting task of deciding what features are known to impact the behavior of existing middleboxes. Here's a preliminary list of things that might fit in this category. For the sake of discussion, let's call them **differentiable features**:\r\n1. The set of extensions that appear to be negotiated;\r\n1. Visible alerts, e.g., \"bad_record_mac\";\r\n1. Number of round trips in a given transport context (e.g., TCP connection);\r\n1. Packet size, or the number of packets comprising a single message;\r\n1. Timing;\r\n1. ...\r\n\r\nI think we should set the following goals for ECH-09 (or some draft that follows it).\r\n1. If we can agree on a set of differentiable features, then we should ensure that this set does not vary between real-ECH and grease-ECH.\r\n1. ECH-08 aims only to mitigate **passive** \"don't stick out\" attacks, but there is a lot of evidence that middleboxes exhibit **active** behavior. (For example, middleboxes have been observed removing CH extensions they don't recognize or adding their own.) Thus, we should aim to thwart attacks that change the set of differentiable features in real-ECH vs. grease-ECH. This includes @huitema's attack in particular: see #353.\r\n1. To the greatest extent possible, the spec should allow for implementations to aim for the strongest possible notion of security. For example, we might consider relaxing the requirement that the outer SNI matches ECHConfig.public_name, so long as this change doesn't impact interoperability.\r\n",

That is clearly impossible (e.g. cjpatton's attack 2).  Instead, the goal is to minimize barriers to deployment of ECH.  If ECH isn't reliable in practice, it won't be widely deployed, and so will not keep the SNI private.\r\n\r\nIn my view, the minimum threshold is: a passive intermediary with only per-connection state must not be able to distinguish ECH from GREASE with confidence for a typical client and server configuration.  Defenses for less common protocol uses and low-grade active intermediaries (e.g. simple replay) are good to have but we shouldn't delay the protocol if they prove difficult.\r\n\r\nI think the only remaining issue to reach this level is Real ECH + resumption (kjacobs second attack).  All the other attacks (a) only affect a subset of GREASE (e.g. resumption GREASE), (b) require the intermediary to be active (emitting or modifying packets), or (c) require the intermediary to have per-server state (e.g. a DNS database or a persistent server profile).  We should build defenses for those cases too where we can, but some are intractable, and that's OK.",

One can often make a second connection to the server. (Perhaps a \"passive and a half\" attack.)\r\n\r\nThat is, suppose the server sent decrypt_failure on bad ECH decryptions. (It no longer does.) You can determine whether ECH is in use by flipping a bit in the ciphertext and seeing if the server notices. That breaks the connection, but you could make a second connection to the server, send your perturbed ClientHello, and not interfere with the original connection.\r\n\r\nWhereas, if your attack involves probing the client's behavior, you'd need to induce the client to start a second connection and not notice the first. Systems do tend to retry on failure, so this isn't _entirely_ implausible, but harder than the first attack.",

      "body": "I just noticed this as I was pondering our various HRR issues. RFC8446, section 4.1.2 says:\r\n\r\n> [...] The client will also send a ClientHello when the server has responded to its ClientHello with a HelloRetryRequest.  In that case, the client MUST send the same ClientHello without modification, except as follows:\r\n>\r\n> * [...various cases regarding existing extensions...]\r\n>\r\n> *  Other modifications that may be allowed by an extension defined in the future *and present in the HelloRetryRequest*.\r\n\r\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-4.1.2\r\n\r\nThe \"and present in the HelloRetryRequest\" portion is fun. In RFC8446 as written, we're not allowed to change the `encrypted_client_hello` extension on the second ClientHello unless the server sent `encrypted_client_hello` in HelloRetryRequest, which it doesn't. With the protocol as-is, it seems we'll at least need some text to deal with the contradiction.\r\n\r\nThe impact is practice is thankfully limited. If the servers does not enforce consistency between the two ClientHellos, it doesn't matter. (They're not required to, but they're not explicitly forbidden from it either, and a stateless server may need to enforce some minimum consistency to avoid getting into a broken state.) If a server does, ECH's behavior on HRR will break it. Such a server is supposed to handshake with ClientHelloOuter, so it just affects the retry flow. That's maybe okay, but mildly annoying. Administrators using server software that checks need to know to first upgrade to a version that doesn't check before trying to deploy ECH.\r\n\r\nWe can also add an ECH extension to HRR. Then, on ECH-reject + HRR, the server perhaps wouldn't send the extension and the client would be required to replay the extension. This is a waste in many ways, but would work. This would break don't stick out, but some threat models, don't stick out with HRR is hopeless anyway. (See https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/pull/352#issuecomment-721824226.) It would also be weirdly asymmetric between ECH and SH.\r\n\r\nThat said, this constraint is also pretty obnoxious. For instance, #313 currently adds a new padding extension codepoint, because the old one isn't defined for other messages. However, the RFC8446 allowance only works for the existing padding code point, so you don't want to send any other code points in ClientHello, lest the server force you to keep it unchanged in ClientHello2. So maybe we should confirm no servers did the fully strict check and undo that constraint? (Although, for #313, I personally favor the padding message strategy anyway.)",

Is that just checking if one of the previously-visited hosts shares a client-facing server with the connection under attack? That seems like something the attacker can regardless.

If I understand you correctly, (3) is:\r\n\r\n* The attacker observes a connection from the client with some config_id and some secret SNI A.\r\n* The attacker queries DNS or the recovery flow[*] for the cleartext SNIs that the client previously visited and sees if one of them, B, has an ECHConfig with matching config_id.\r\n* If there is a match, the attacker learns that B was in the same anonymity set as A.\r\n\r\nThe attacker learns this whether or not the connection resumes. The attacker also hasn't expanded the anonymity sent. In fact, they didn't even need to query sites the client previously visited. They could just as easily query the top N sites or a list of popular hosting providers known to support ECH. I think this information is part of the baseline for our security goals.\r\n\r\nIt is true that a client which, before ECH, leaked that it visited A many times is more likely to visit A again in the future. That seems fundamental. I think the interesting thing is that (2) tells the observer that it is *some* repeat visit, which increases the chance it's A. (But doesn't guarantee it. Maybe I've found a new site in the anonymity set that I like.)\r\n\r\nI don't think PSK separation even mitigates this. Repeat post-ECH visits still reveal whether resumption happened in ServerHello. And even if we fixed that, depending on how much padding the client is willing to add, the ClientHello size will reveal whether the client had a ticket to offer. I think the only thing PSK separation mitigates is that _immediately_ after the client/server pair deploys ECH, you get to reset the repeat visit counter.

However, at this point, the client does not know whether the server processed ClientHelloOuter or ClientHelloInner\"\r\n\r\nWhen does the client learn whether the server processed ClientHelloOuter or ClientHelloInner? If the client sees that the last 8 bytes of ServerHello.random were set to the first 8 bytes of `accept_confirmation`, does it just assume that the first ClientHello that the server processed was a ClientHelloInner? That seems like a big assumption. Couldn't the following happen?:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClient                           Client-facing server             Backend server\r\n              CHO(CHI)\r\n           ------------->\r\n                                   (processes CHO)\r\n                HRR\r\n           <-------------\r\n              CHO(CHI)\r\n           ------------->\r\n                                                          CHI\r\n                                                      ----------->\r\n                                                                  (processes CHI)\r\n                            SH\r\n          <-----------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this can happen, the client will assume, after it receives the SH, that the server processed the first ClientHelloInner, but this is in fact not the case, and the transcript will break. I mean, I guess that's okay if you don't want this behavior to succeed, but AFAICT, the draft doesn't explicitly say that the client-facing server shouldn't do this. Should it?\r\n\r\n(Sorry if this is in fact already resolved somewhere in the draft. Also I'm pretty sure it's a different issue from https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/issues/333.)",

      "body": "I wanted to jot this down before the holidays, in advance of writing a more rigorous PR. This is a proposal to go fix all our HRR problems in one swoop (#233, #373, #358, and #333).\r\n\r\nFirst, whatever our \"don't stick out\" goals are (#354), sticking out on true HRR flows is pretty much hopeless if the attacker is allowed to make a second connection and probe server behavior: replay the first ClientHello and then perturb the second ClientHello's ciphertext. The server can't change its mind after the fact. So I'm going to intentionally give up on that, which means fixing #358 is possible. The proposal is thus:\r\n\r\n* The client sends ClientHelloOuter1 and ClientHelloInner1 as in the current document.\r\n* If client-facing server accepts ECH, it forwards ClientHelloInner1 to the backend server, as before.\r\n* If the backend server sends HelloRetryRequest in response, call this HelloRetryRequestInner.\r\n* The backend server constructs HelloRetryRequestOuter containing the following:\r\n  * An encrypted_client_hello extension with the HelloRetryRequestInner, encrypted with the HPKE context (see open questions).\r\n  * Optionally, a cookie extension with the outer cookie (fixes #333)\r\n  * No other extensions are allowed, though future extensions, if solicited by ClientHelloOuter1 may change this. (See open questions.)\r\n* HelloRetryRequests signals to the client whether ECH was accepted or not (fixes #373, avoids #316) by the presence of the encrypted_client_hello extension:\r\n* If there is no encrypted_client_hello extension, the client computes ClientHello2 based on ClientHelloOuter1 and HelloRetryRequest. There is no more ClientHelloInner2. We're not doing ECH, and HRR may not even be valid for CHI2 (the #316 mess). Instead, it blindly copies over ClientHelloOuter1's extension. This is a waste of bytes, but fixes #358.\r\n* If there is an encrypted_client_hello extension...\r\n  * First, the client decrypts HelloRetryRequestInner. If it fails, it sends decrypt_failure and aborts. GREASE ECH is considered to always fail to decrypt and always sends decrypt_failure.\r\n  * Otherwise, the client computes ClientHelloInner2 based on HelloRetryRequestInner in the usual way, handling errors in the usual way.\r\n  * The client constructs ClientHelloOuter2 containing the encrypted ClientHelloInner2 and HelloRetryRequestOuter.cookie. We know the server is accepting ECH at this point, so there is no need to send much of any other fields. See open questions below.\r\n* HRR or not, the ServerHello is required to have an ECH acceptance confirmation as usual. The client processes it as follows:\r\n  * If there was no HRR, do what the document currently says and figure out ECH acceptance here.\r\n  * If there was an HRR, you already know ECH accept or reject. If ECH reject, move and and complete the outer handshake without any fuss. The inner handshake terminated too early to compute handshake_secret anyway. If ECH accept, check the acceptance confirmation and send illegal_parameter or so if it's wrong. (See open questions below)\r\n\r\nI believe this solves our various HRR problems:\r\n\r\n* The client-facing server can send an HRR cookie without coordinating with the inner handshake (#333).\r\n* The client does not need to evaluate one HRR against two different ClientHellos, so the two ClientHellos can have arbitrarily different preferences (#233, #316).\r\n* The client knows ECH accept at the first server response, so it does not need to construct two different second ClientHellos (#373).\r\n* The ECH extension only changes when solicited (#358).\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\n### Open questions\r\n\r\n#### How and should we encrypt HelloRetryRequestInner?\r\n\r\nThe above sketch encrypts HRRInner, but HPKE only allows the sender to encrypt. This is easy to specify though: use the exporters to derive another AEAD key and toss it into the HPKE cipher suite's AEAD.\r\n\r\nAs for why encrypt it, things should still work if we stick it in the clear. But we may want to for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Like backend server tickets, backend server cookies are, today, not particularly constrained w.r.t. what they reveal. A ticket or cookie from one TLS implementation may be different from the other, and Split Mode servers may have multiple backend implementations in their anonymity set. It may also vary for other reasons. NewSessionTicket is encrypted, as is the pre_shared_key extension, so we've solved it for tickets. ClientHello.cookie is also encrypted, which leaves HRR.cookie. Encrypting HRRInner fills that in.\r\n2. If HRRInner is not authenticated by the HPKE context, an attacker can try to distinguish GREASE by sending a fake cleartext HRRInner and seeing how the client responds. Authenticating HRRInner means you cannot spoof an inner HRR flow.\r\n\r\nWhether the second property is worthwhile is unclear (https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/issues/354#issuecomment-743924431), but I think the first property is valuable, at which point we get the second anyway.\r\n\r\n#### Other HelloRetryRequestOuter extensions? What is ClientHelloOuter2?\r\n\r\nThis design avoids #316 by assembling a cursory ClientHelloOuter2, rather than actually trying to continue the outer handshake. We would need to decide how to do that. I can think of a few possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. Simply specify throwaway values for all the non-extension fields and declare ClientHelloOuter2 contains exactly two extensions, an optional cookie and encrypted_client_hello. EncodedClientHelloInner2 does not bother with outer_extensions because there is nothing to compress.\r\n2. Make up a new message type to avoid the throwaway fields.\r\n3. ~~Compute an actual ClientHelloOuter2, following RFC8446, based on ClientHelloOuter1 and HelloRetryRequestOuter. If HelloRetryRequestOuter wants to request new key_shares, that's fine. it's just pointless.~~\r\n\r\nI don't like option 3. It's conceptually kinda clever, but adds unnecessary fuss to the protocol. Consider a client which sends CHO1.key_share == CHI1.key_share and compresses them. Key share preferences are rarely secret and this avoids doubling up potentially large post-quantum values.\r\n\r\nThe backend server now requests HRR because it wanted a different key share. So CHI2.key_share != CHI1.key_share and is based on HRRI.key_share. But the client-facing server probably did the straightforward thing and didn't send HRRO.key_share because there's no point. It'll never process CHO2.\r\n\r\nOption 3 would then require that CHO2.key_share == CHO1.key_share because HRRO did not request a change. That means CHO2.key_share != CHI2.key_share and the client must waste a lot of bytes sending two of them. In contrast, options 1 and 2 say that CHO2.key_share doesn't exist anyway, so we only ever send one key share.\r\n\r\nIt also adds implementation complexity to the client, which now needs to evaluate two different full-featured HRRs in one handshake, despite it being unused.\r\n\r\nOption 1 and 2 are basically equivalent, though it's worth noting that HRRO and CHO2 do not _quite_ have the same rules as anymore, so whether we want to stick them in the same message type is interesting...\r\n\r\n#### SH.random acceptance signal after HRR?\r\n\r\nAfter HRR, the SH.random acceptance signal doesn't do anything. We could just as easily omit it, because the client has already gotten the signal. The above sketch keeps it in, mostly for consistency's sake: right now we require that backend servers support the ech_is_inner extension. Getting this wrong will be noticed because the client will not successfully complete the connection. If we omit the acceptance signal in HRR flows, the client will no longer consistently notice. As long as we have this requirement, enforcing it uniformly is more robust, so I'm thinking we keep it in there.\r\n\r\n#### Copy or omit CH2.encrypted_client_hello on reject?\r\n\r\nThis sketch says to copy CH2.encrypted_client_hello on ECH reject. This is a waste of bytes but retains compatibility with RFC8446's rules. In particular, we know of a compatibility issue in #358. It seemed from the WG discussion we generally think the RFC8446 rules are wrong, so we could intentionally break them and drop the extension.\r\n\r\nMy inclination is we should try to get the rule changed and implementations fixed, but maybe that should happen separately from ECH and we copy it for now.",

One request: It seems like some design decisions are aimed at reducing the communication overhead compared to ECH-09. For now, I would prefer we leave out of t he PR any such optimization that adds implementation complexity. In particular, I think the client should compute a real ClientHelloOuter2 as usual (as in option (3.) above) rather than do something different (as in option (1.) or (2.)). The alternatives seem somewhat invasive; and if their only benefit is improved communication overhead, then given how rare the HRR code path is in practice, I don't think it's worth doing.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm sold on the privacy benefits of encrypting HRRInner. However, I think we should punt this to a future PR. Two reasons. First, I think this privacy consideration is orthogonal to the issue at hand. Second, the details aren't straight-forward; we'll have to agree on how to pick the nonce, associated data, how to pad, and so on. I think we'll do ourselves a big favor by untangling these things :)",

Just dropping the\ncompression idea entirely: even better:-)\n\nGiven this optimisation is really mostly for PQ schemes, I'd\nargue it'd be better to just drop the current idea and have\na more constrained one, e.g. using a bit mask as the value\nof outer_extensions, so implementation know exactly which\nextensions can ever be copied from the outer CH.\n\nAnd I'd further argue we can leave defining all of that\nuntil later too.\n\nThe current scheme also imposes quite a testing burden.\nAt least with OpenSSL most extensions have some side-effect\nand testing that all combinations of those are handled\ncorrectly for the inner CH isn't trivial. (That's partly\ndown to old code being a bit awful but I guess won't be\nsimple for any code base.)\n\nCheers,\nS.\n\n\n\n> \n> (For a simpler decoder, we already require CHInner group the\n> compressed extensions consecutively.

Tickets are issued encrypted and, in ECH, even sent encrypted. Even if they were sent in the clear, TLS 1.3's [single-use tickets](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#appendix-C.4) protects against such correlations. Rather, the correlation in #369 is a much weaker one: based on either the size of the ClientHello or whether the server accepted the ticket, you learn a single bit for whether it was *some* previous connection made by that client. You don't know which previous connection it was, and you don't know if it was an ECH connection or a non-ECH connection. In fact what you learn... more-or-less aligns with the anonymity set.

(1) says that, in actual ECH, all outer ClientHellos have no PSK. In GREASE ECH, some outer ClientHellos have a PSK while some do not.

Even without compression, you fundamentally need to decide what you put in the outer vs. inner ClientHello on the client.\r\n\r\n* Is the ClientHello extension dependent on sensitive data? Put it in just the inner ClientHello.\r\n* Is the ClientHello extension is public and you want to your ECH/non-ECH wire images to match here? Put it in both.\r\n* Is it sensitive but you still want an outer value? The API will need to somehow construct both values and help the application process the server response correctly.\r\n* Is the application assuming that all handshakes are offered this extension? You'll need to put something in both, one way or another, since the server may handshake either ClientHello.\r\n\r\nNone of these decisions are related to compression. They're fundamental to the whole outer vs. inner ClientHello design of ECH.\r\n\r\nOnce you've made that decision, whether to compress follows naturally.\r\n\r\n* If you only put it in the inner ClientHello, this is moot.\r\n* If you put it in both and they were publicly equal, may as well compress it.\r\n* If you put it in both and they were not publicly equal, don't compress it.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I don't think such custom extensions APIs are a good idea. There's no guarantee that future TLS versions won't change how extensions are used, which means they're very hard to make backwards-compatible. ECH changes extension-handling on the client, and TLS 1.3 changed it dramatically across the board.",

So putting aside the complexity (of implementation and testing) point temporarily, the other reasons listed seem to fall into one of three categories: YAGNI, library integration challenges (choosing what to compress, how to expose it, and how it interacts with custom extension handlers), and increased fingerprinting. \r\n\r\n1. YAGNI: David's comments and links to PQ KEMs coming down the pipe seem to suggest this isn't a case of YAGNI.\r\n2. Library integration: This seems mostly an issue for the library in question, and less so a problem that applies to all implementations. For example, not all TLS stacks have custom extension support anymore. (IIRC, BoringSSL had it at one point, but it was long ago removed. @davidben can confirm.) On the API point, too, it's not clear to me that exposing this as a general purpose API is something that stacks should do. Implementations can probably make reasonable decisions about what to compress and what not to compress, as David points out, without consulting the application.\r\n3. Increased fingerprinting: This is a good point, and something we specifically have in the TLS WG charter to as a goal to mitigate. \r\n\r\nGiven the above, would a reasonable (and simpler?) alternative be to *only* compress the key share extension?",

Also, any validation on the URL parsing / DNS query path happens in the process of making a request to the DNS server at all, whereas any validation here would be a check afterwards on the result.

Should the ECHConfig be allowed to supply IP addresses? And if so, how do client stacks validate them?\r\n2. Should clients be allowed to validate servers using IP addresses as a reference identity? (If yes, then the ClientHelloOuter.SNI must be allowed to be empty/omitted.)\r\n\r\nI think (2) should be 'yes', given that's currently possible today introduces no new complexity.

It can't use the public IP (because it doesn't know it always), but it can still populate server_name according to the value of public_name.  I might have missed something there though.\r\n\r\nFrom David's [options](https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/issues/424#issuecomment-822608586), option 1 is a bit silly (it adds unnecessary latency), but it also gives you the best locality if your goal is to use the proxy egress as the client network location (option 2 as Ben [suggests](https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/issues/424#issuecomment-822613850) only works if you care about the network location of the client, at which point you might as well not use a proxy).

Domain names are typically more closely linked to an organization than IP addresses (especially with VM hosting), and more expensive to change.\r\n\r\nAn IP address `public_name` ensures that the client does not populate the outer SNI, and supports a configuration where the default certificate only contains an IP address SAN.  This minimizes the information visible to an adversary unless they can also identify the service that runs on this IP address (e.g. by scanning the whole DNS).\r\n\r\nAn alternative to IP address in `public_name` would be a flag in the ECHConfig indicating that the specified reference identity is in the default certificate (which is implicitly true for IP reference identities).  This would allow clients to omit the SNI, improving small services' privacy against a passive adversary, but active adversaries could fetch the default certificate to learn the `public_name`.",

There might be cases where fallback is not needed.\r\n\r\nI don't think we should open that can of worms. Even though not having a fallback flow is really the server's decision, I think the client has a stake in this too. It's useful to nudge the ecosystem towards things that work well. If a server deploys without fallback, underestimating the predictability of DNS caching, it will break rarely in some clients. That sort of thing is bad UX and increases the pressure for clients to adopt insecure fallbacks. Unless there is a clear need, I don't think we should allow that. (Otherwise not setting it up is deceptively attractive for a naive server since they make fewer decision.)\r\n\r\nThe extensibility story for ECH is a little funny. You send an ECHConfigList and the client ignores any ECHConfigs it can't understand. So if we say today's ECH clients require a public_name extension, future ECH clients can still support a public_ip extension that relaxes the public_name requirement. Today's ECH clients will just ignore the public_ip-using configs, which is the desired behavior.\r\n\r\nBut I should say I have no stake in this IP mess and do not care whether we allow those. Just pick something that everyone's happy with, please. #426 was an attempt to punt this out of the draft while keeping all the existing semantics unchanged (hence required extension; the correct reading is that it is *purely* an encoding change).",

(I do have some\n   code to embed random file content in an ECHConfig but have\n   not really tried it out.)\n- We can use multi-valued RRs to handle the case where we\n   need both an \"old\" and \"new\" form with different version\n   encodings.\n\nWriting code to produce, consume, test, fuzz etc. extensions\nwhen we have no current real uses for extensions is wasted\neffort. The extension consuming code is likely to be less\nwell tested over time and hence represent a risk. If we don't\nneed to take that risk, we ought not.\n\nSeparately on criticality, I'll just repeat what I said in\nthe other issue/thread:\n\nThe \"critical\" bit in x.509 extensions IMO didn't work. IIRC\nwe really designed it for the basicConstraints extension, as\nthat had to be understood by relying parties, but the result\nwas that we more or less only had one shot at introducing any\ncritical extensions - unless I'm forgetting stuff (which is\nentirely possible:-) pretty much all later attempts to add\nnew critical extensions failed as they'd break deployed\nclients.

      "body": "Filing this as a topic for discussion. I think \"we don't like these padding strategies\" or \"that's not too complicated\" are perfectly plausible answers.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to pad the ECH payload to avoid revealing information via length. It seems to me there are two plausible strategies for padding, and you could do one or both of them. (You could do both by applying the first, then applying the second.)\r\n\r\n_NB: I don't know what the overall consensus is on padding strategies. My assumption has been that there isn't one and we're building flexibility into protocols so we can figure it out. The below is a summary of my current thinking, but there are probably lots of well-established ideas I don't know._ \r\n\r\n**Pad particular fields you are trying to hide**\r\nThere may be a particular field in your message with a length distribution you would like to hide. Perhaps some anonymity set has server name lengths up to 96 bytes. So you arrange for the client to know this, and the client adds 96 - len(server_name) extra bytes to the ClientHello somewhere. This is easy to reason about in isolation, but only considers individual fields. Information about other fields still leaks.\r\n\r\n**Generically reduce the range of possible lengths**\r\nYou may also just try to generically reduce the range of the function. Maybe you round to a multiple of 32, or round to the next power of some R > 1. This may still leak information: padding a multiple of 32 still distinguishes (big server name, big ALPN list) and (small server name, small ALPN list) when the variance is more than 32 bytes. But it pretty uniformly reduces the information leaked in general, which can help increase anonymity sets. For example, an HTTP client will always sends an ALPN of {h2, http/1.1}, but a tiny amount of overall padding can help combine HTTP ClientHellos with a non-HTTP client that might have a slightly different ALPN set. It can also mitigate mistakes. For instance, TLS tickets often embed the server name. If the server forgets to pad that when minting the ticket, the first strategy alone will leak this.\r\n\r\nThe recommended padding scheme currently only does the first kind. We add padding for server_name and largely ignore the other fields. Suppose some client wanted to additionally use the second strategy. The order of operations here is fussy and interleaves bits of ClientHelloInner and EncodedClientHelloInner:\r\n\r\n* EncodedClientHelloInner has a PSK binder\r\n* ...which depends on the non-PSK extensions of ClientHelloInner\r\n* ...which includes the padding extension\r\n* ...which depends on the length of the non-padding extensions of EncodedClientHelloInner\r\n* ...which depends on the length of the PSK binder, the non-PSK non-padding extensions of ClientHelloInner, which of them will be compressed\r\n\r\nThis is not actually a circular dependency. But it's a place the ClientHelloInner and EncodedClientHelloInner are awkward linked together. Probably the way to do it is to maintain a count of how much smaller EncodedClientHelloInner will be and subtract that from the ClientHelloInner as you construct and pad it.\r\n\r\n*If* we think this is a problem, the fix is pretty straightforward: add padding to EncodedClientHelloInner itself. Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct {\r\n  ClientHello client_hello;\r\n  opaque padding<0..2^16-1>;\r\n} EncodedClientHelloInner;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the ClientHelloInner no longer depends on the length of the EncodedClientHelloInner. Is this worth doing?",

I suppose one could also include the padding extension on ClientHelloInner, but that becomes weird when you consider the ticket/binder example you raise. In general, the current draft text here does seem to be an artifact of the pre-ECH padding story. Since we're now covering multiple things in the ClientHello, applying padding more broadly seems right. I think it boils down to where we put those bits. (Your suggestion seems perfectly fine, and shouldn't be too onerous to implement. It should work fairly nicely with [our current implementation](https://github.com/cloudflare/go/blob/71ba4a16b1db8a2b5f2b0f857142fc1938134a1e/src/crypto/tls/ech.go#L464).)\r\n\r\n@cjpatton, what do you think?",

Rather, it seems it will increase the likelihood of issues with ECH as a whole.\r\n\r\nThere are already a lot of TLS 1.3 servers out there, and none of them send ECH extensions in SH. While those servers can and perhaps will eventually be updated, compatibility for _particular_[*], defined extensions is an early stage risk. Once an extension is wildly deployed, it's already part of selection pressures. Servers may deploy this greasing mechanism faster than ECH itself, but it's an added risk and inefficiency.\r\n\r\nFor HRR, we're stuck with that risk (and more, because HRR greasing isn't as effective, per https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/issues/450#issuecomment-859667016). For SH, we're not. It doesn't make sense to intentionally take on more risk on SH when it doesn't affect the HRR risk. The incentives are also different here because HRR is so rare.\r\n\r\nIn particular, if we're worried about the ecosystem allowing ECH + SH, but not ECH + HRR, using the same mechanism won't help. SH and HRR extensions do not use the same syntax, so whether an ecosystem tolerates an extension SH has no relation to whether it tolerates it in HRR. We need to counter the fact that HRR is rare, with strategies like https://crbug.com/677254 (which we have not implemented).\r\n\r\nI agree that, aesthetically, the difference is weird.

IIUC (and I\nmay not) haproxy doesn't want to act as an http server\nin any case, so no DocRoot nor any equivalent. (It can\nterminate TLS of course but I don't think it ever emits\nan HTTP response of it's own creation.)\n\nThat may mean, in the event of failed ECH decryption,\n(incl. GREASE) or when no ECH key pair is configured\nit may make more sense for haproxy to pass on the outer\nCH to what it calls a \"backend\" which is an http server.\n\nLike I say, this is v. preliminary and maybe wrong but\nat least for me, I'd not previously considered that the\nclient-facing server might not be an http server at all.\n\nPut another way - it could be the thing with the ECH\nprivate key is not the thing with the private key that\ngoes with ECH.public_name.\n\nIOW, I think the kind of description suggested by\nDavid might be a good direction to explore a bit.\n\nCheers,\nS.\n\n\n> \n",

          "body": "> Don't update the ECH extension\r\n\r\nSorry, this part of my suggestion above doesn't work. I think you need the client to refresh it, otherwise you determine if ECH was accepted just by looking at whether the client changed the extension.\r\n\r\nThat said, GREASEing this may not be all that useful. It's not too difficult to tell if a server that sent HRR did so with ECH or not, if you're willing to probe the server's behavior on a parallel connection. First, there's this pretty straightforward version:\r\n\r\n1. Observe ClientHello and HelloRetryRequest pair from a client and server. Note this only happens if the (client, server) pair would naturally negotiate HRR.\r\n2. Replay ClientHello to that server on a separate connection. You should get HelloRetryRequest with the same parameters because the server's parameter selection is deterministic. (Let's suppose the server did not need to sporadically request a cookie.)\r\n3. See if HelloRetryRequest.ech contained the exact same bytes or not.\r\n\r\nHRR contains no server entropy, replaying an ECH ClientHello will give you something consistent, while a naive GREASED implementation will give you different values. We could fix this in one of two ways:\r\n\r\n* HRR GREASE should, instead of random bytes, do something deterministic like KDF(server_secret, client_hello), or\r\n* Change ECH confirmation to be a concatenation of some server entropy and the signal computed over the entropy.\r\n\r\nBut, for that fuss, it doesn't plug the more fundamental distinguisher, which is probably hopeless:\r\n\r\n1. Observe ClientHello and HelloRetryRequest pair from a client and server again.\r\n2. Replay ClientHello to that server on a separate connection. You should get HelloRetryRequest with the same parameters again.\r\n3. Second a second ClientHello with a plausible ClientHelloOuter2 and random bytes for the encrypted payload.\r\n4. If the server accepted ECH, it will attempt to decrypt the random bytes, fail, and abort the connection. If the server rejected ECH, it will ignore the payload and handshake with ClientHelloOuter2.\r\n\r\nThis one seems pretty much fundamental. Deciding ECH at ServerHello sets up handshake secrets at the same time. But deciding ECH at HRR means the server has committed to looking at ClientHelloOuter vs. ClientHelloInner too early. (This is true whether we have an acceptance signal at the client or not. Even in the \"apply HRR to both ClientHellos\" model, the server has already made a decision, because it needed to in order to decide on HRR at all. That model just had the client learn the decision late.)",

If ECH is rejected, how can it even be expected to know what backend server the client is trying to talk to?\r\n\r\nThe outer ClientHello contains a server name. If you believe the client-facing server is just a dispatcher, then maybe you just dispatch. In particular, if `example.com`'s DNS points to some IP address A and ECH keys, a client that didn't support that ECH cipher, didn't support ECH, or otherwise couldn't get the DNS record would connect to A without offering ECH.

After carefully reading over these sections multiple times, I do get the message, but I feel like it could be better worded as not to create confusion. The words \"MITM proxy\" could refer to the forwarding middlebox as well.

Or, more accurately, it's required to send a ClientHello only containing things it supports. Whether it choses to base its capabilities on the original ClientHello is its business. Though, of course, there are security implications for either option and more reason why MITM proxies are a terrible idea.\r\n\r\nEither way, if you are a MITM proxy, you are terminating TLS, which means there are two TLS handshakes and, in one of them, you are a client. When acting as a client, you cannot send things you don't understand. Otherwise the server will respond in a way that confuses you.\r\n\r\n> However, looking at RFC 8446 Section 9.3, the first section you encounter on forwarding middleboxes explicitly states the opposite: the middlebox is not allowed to change or modify any parameters in the handshake and subsequent traffic if it doesn't understand some parameter in the ClientHello:\r\n\r\nRFC 8446 does not discuss \"forwarding middleboxes\" at all. That section talks about a \"middlebox which forwards ClientHello parameters _it does not understand_\". Any middlebox that does this cannot terminate TLS in the first place (i.e. not a MITM proxy) because anyone terminating TLS is limited to only sending things it understands.\r\n\r\nRather, this section is talking about non-terminating proxies that attempt to inspect the cleartext portions of TLS anyway. We ran into quite a lot of those in the process of deploying TLS 1.3 and most of them were broken. This text clarifies that TLS promises no continuity of syntax after the ClientHello. A non-terminating proxy gets to assume it can parse the ClientHello and nothing else.\r\n\r\n> The words \"MITM proxy\" could refer to the forwarding middlebox as well. \r\n\r\nSee above. If you're forwarding things you understand, you cannot terminate TLS. The section doesn't apply to what this draft refers to as \"MITM proxy\" at all. (Well, there are some weird things that try to selectively proxy TLS. There are [quite a lot of problems](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2018/03/10/tls13.html) with this approach, but in that case which rules apply depends on which choice the proxy made. Additionally, the proxy cannot violate the forwarding middlebox rule in the process of making the decision. This basically boils down to saying you cannot make your decision based on anything after the ClientHello because, after that point, you cannot parse anything.)\r\n\r\nProbably we should change this draft to match RFC 8446 in terminology and replace \"MITM proxies\" with \"TLS-terminating proxies\".\r\n\r\n> Section 9.3 requires that such proxies generate their own ClientHello containing only parameters they understand.\r\n\r\nYeah, I think that change is a good one.",

Every draft protocol is doomed to die, which means that no server can, right now, produce a stable ECH deployment. They are guaranteed that some future ECH-capable clients will reject their `ECHConfigList`.\r\n\r\nAnd from the client's perspective, I would be very uncomfortable implementing this mechanism before we understand a bit better how ECH works in practice. How likely are rollbacks? How stale of DNS do we see in practice? How much of a concern are users who switch back and forth from a TLS-terminating middlebox, with all the problems that comes with?\r\n\r\nFinally, is changing the outer `ECHConfigList` structure even an option at this point? Didn't you all have a lot of troubles with renaming the SvcParam, and that didn't even affect the wire format? Changing `ECHConfigList` would _actually_ be a wire-format change.

It seems there is plenty of room for implementations to arise which generate GREASE payload lengths that are susceptible to effective differentiation by heuristics simple enough to be within reach of the very lazy attacker of 10.9.4.  Perhaps such implementations use a fixed size 'prototype ClientHello' concept, or use something highly self-similar (e.g., verbatim non-ECH ClientHello contents), or [insert other debacle].

      "body": "(Originating at #509)\r\n\r\nThere appears to be nothing in the document concerning an attacker with a presence on both side of the client-facing server in split mode defeating ECH privacy by correlating connections across the client-facing server.\r\n\r\nConsider an attacker present on both sides of a client-facing server whose goal is to uncover which backend server(s) specific ECH-using clients are accessing.  By virtue of its position in the network, this attacker:\r\n\r\n1. Can, through passive observation of the traffic on the client side of the client-facing server, maintain a list of ECH connections initiated by each client identity of interest to the client-facing server (client identity based on the available information: transport addressing, ClientHelloOuter parameters that are in the plain, protocol timing...).\r\n2. Can, through passive observation of the traffic on the backend-server side of the client-facing server, maintain a list of ECH connections initiated from the client-facing server to the backend servers along with their corresponding SNI values, as at this point ClientHello is ClientHelloInner in the plain. \r\n3. Can uncover the SNI value being used by a particular client connection in list (1) if it can match it to its corresponding connection in list (2).\r\n4. Does not necessarily have to perform this matching in any particular temporal relation to the evolution of the connection in order to achieve its goal.\r\n\r\nAttacks:\r\n\r\n1. Passive flow tagging using time dilation:  At one position, the attacker chooses a target ECH connection and introduces a time dilation between two events (by delaying packets) whose relative timing otherwise has statistics stable enough to reliably detect the injected outlier at the attacker's other position.  The attacker annotates the connection in the list on the side the dilation is inserted with the time of the operation, and annotates the connection list at its other position with the time that outlier timing for that event was detected.  Later, connections are matched when recorded time values for a pair of entries (one from each connection list) are suitably related (the arithmetic left as an exercise for the reader).  One event pair might be observed ClientHello -> ServerHello timing.  Or it could be something more opportunistic, such as the arrival time of two successive records in a large backend server initial flight.  The attacker may be able to enhance the capacity of this attack by using multiple distinguishable dilation values, which would allow it to be applied to multiple connections within the same time window.\r\n2. Non-destructive active flow tagging I: On the client side, the attacker picks a target ECH connection from the client and inserts a change_cipher_spec record consisting of the single byte value 0x1 following ClientHello, and annotates the connection in the client-side list with the time at which the operation was performed.  On the backend-server side, the attacker annotates the entry in its list for the connection on which such a change_cipher_spec is observed with the time at which it is observed.  The attacker controls the interval at which it employs the attack such that given the path delay characteristics and clock synchronization limits, it can successfully match the annotated list entries.  The attacker can enhance the capacity of this attack by employing multiple differentiable time delay values between the ClientHello and the change_cipher_spec it inserts, enabling its use on multiple connections within the same time window.  Such change_cipher_spec records may also be employed by the client for their intended purpose, but the attacker can likely filter them out to protect the fidelity of its attack (and if necessary, unconditionally reinsert them at its position on the other side), as it is unlikely that the client-facing server and the infrastructure behind it require them for correct operation.  Deployed TLS 1.3 implementations that tolerate multiple such change_cipher_spec records would provide an expanded capacity to the attacker as being able to insert a variable number of records would further expand the concurrency space.  This attack could also be run in the other direction.  This attack only requires an active position on one side.\r\n3. Non-destructive active flow tagging II: On any given ECH connection on the client side, after the client-facing server enters forwarding mode, the attacker inserts a fake record whose payload contains a tag identifying it to its other position as such a record as well as indicating an attacker-assigned connection ID.  The client-facing server dutifully forwards the fake record, after which the attacker receives it at its backend-server side position, identifies the tag in the payload, removes the record from the flow, and annotates the associated entry in its connection list with the connection ID.  This could also be implemented as a length extension of otherwise legitimate records, with the additional payload removed at the second position.  This attack could also be run in the other direction.  This attack requires an active position on both sides.\r\n4. Destructive active flow tagging: Once the client-facing server has entered forwarding mode for a given ECH connection, the attacker can overwrite a portion of the payload of an existing record with the tag described in (3), with the same processing of the tag content at the attacker's other position.  As this will cause the connection to be aborted, it would only be useful on a sampling basis.  The attacker may be able to reduce the observability of this attack by opportunistically applying it to alerts it detects through traffic analysis.  This attack could be applied in either direction.  This attack only requires an active position on one side.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If we pursue (1), it seems something more would need to be said than simply that the link between the client facing server and the backend server achieves \"no-visibilty\" via encryption, at the very least to head off interpretation of \"via encryption\" to mean direct forwarding of the ciphertexts.

Such messages should have no reason to exist on the link between a client facing server and a backend server.  I haven't yet attempted a full survey of extant implementations, but it does appear OpenSSL, in a TLS 1.3 handshake, will ignore up to 32 of them appearing consecutively between handshake records, which looks like quite a bit of leeway for exploitation.",

Shared-mode had nothing much interesting about it (mostly similar to nginx, apache, lighttpd) but split-mode threw up what was for me a new thing. (My notes on that are [here](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/blob/ECH_UPFRONT_DEC/esnistuff/haproxy.md#split-mode).)\r\n\r\nThe main thing is that, in split-mode, haproxy will decrypt the ECH fine and can then pass on the inner CH and allow the TLS h/s to continue between client and backend, but haproxy can't act as the server for the public_name as it goes out of its way to avoid being a web server. That wasn't a hard problem to handle though as I just route e.g. all non-decrypted TLS sessions to yet another external web server instance, that has the private key corresponding to ECHConfig.public_name, and which is only ECH-special in that it has to be able to answer GREASEd CH's. (But it is a bit ECH special in answering GREASE while not being a full shared-mode instance which needed a few tweaks in my server code to handle having an ECHConflg but no private key.)\r\n\r\nSo all that worked ok, and isn't really visible to the client, but if other deployments are similar we might want to recast the description of split mode to note this three-way aspect. In particular, I guess this kind of setup allows for a situation where we have could have many different public_name values for one or a small number of ECH public_key values, independent of the size of the anonymity set of will-be-encrypted SNI names protected via the ECH public_key values. I guess that's not likely what a CDN might want to do (as it probably only wants/needs to use one or a few public_name values) but maybe it'd be useful for some reason, not sure. (Looking at the mega-flexibility of the haproxy config, I'm guessing haproxy has already been deployed in many unexpected ways;-)\r\n\r\nThe three-way thing might also be relevant for security analyses, not sure.\r\n\r\nLastly, that three-way aspect means that we'd better not change the protocol in any way that assumes that the ECH private key holder has access to information only known to the public_name private key holder. So far that's fine and will likely stay so, but it's a maybe non-obvious invariant we should keep.\r\n",

Fine.\r\n\r\nBut what does ECH acceptance mean in Split Mode?\r\n\r\nAt the moment, we do not prohibit backend servers signaling ECH acceptance against connections that originate from arbitrary location.\r\n\r\nIf backend servers are to accept connections from arbitrary client-facing servers and respond with an ECH accept confirmation, it becomes trivial for a network operator controlling DNS responses to setup a client-facing proxy. If such a client-facing proxy acting as a transparent proxy is setup by a local network operator, then the IP address of the client and the SNI would be visible on the Internet. I would be hesitant to say that ECH is providing any value in such scenario.\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase, in contrast to Shared Mode, ECH acceptance means very little when the server is in Split Mode.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, section 10.9.6 (Enable Multi-party Security Contexts) states that \u201cassuming ECH records retrieved from DNS are authenticated (snip) Resolver, spoofing a client-facing server operating in Split Mode is not possible.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut I wonder if we should better be more direct about the problem. To give an example, it might be a good idea to state in Section 3 (Topologies) that use of a secure channel between the client-facing server and backend server is assumed, and that otherwise spoofing is possible.",

At least its trivial to accomplish as long as the client MUST use sufficiently cryptographically distinct info in its inner/outer client hellos that the transcript hash is sufficiently distinct) - ultimately successfully authenticated the server against both the (optionally) CA-signed certificate, and the ECH key fetched from the DNS. This has given the client two \"roots of trust\" for the authentication of their connection!\r\n\r\nHowever, currently, a server can reject ECH in a number of ways (negotiating TLS < 1.3, using ClientHelloOuter, etc). In such a case we fall back to only the CA as the root of trust. The simplest approach to allowing a server to opt in to the dual root of trust required world would be to add a bit in the HTTPS RR which indicates that a client which supports ECH MUST return a failure to the calling application if the server rejects ECH (after all retry_configs have been exhausted, if any).\r\n\r\nThis does end up with a similar result as DANE (where if the server tries to authenticate with a cert other than the specified one, failure occurs). However, it has a number of advantages over DANE - (a) obviously the implementation path I mentioned above, (b) it doesn't require checking the DNSSEC AD flag on the client, which was a major sticking point for DANE integration in browsers (these days with DoH this could be revisited given checking the AD flag is trivial now, but I'm not holding my breath), (c) doesn't require DNSSEC on the domain (which was also a major sticking point for DANE adoption, though things are shifting glacially for email). As described in 10.2 of the current ECH draft-15 while DNSSEC is an additional defense, worry over this bit being \"misused\" to break handshakes via poising or so isn't a big concern.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the server could be allowed to reject ECH with proof that it has decrypted the inner client hello, but that's likely substantially more complexity especially at this later stage of the design.",

There are, of course, many many potential attacks which this doesn't help with, but there are absolutely real setups where this provides a meaningful difference.\r\n\r\n> Without at least checking DNSSEC, you aren't actually getting a second root of trust\r\n\r\nSure you are, just not necessarily a particularly secure one! Luckily ~every DNS resolver software written in the past 20 years validates DNSSEC by default, so as long as your connection to your resolver is secure (which for many people it is, within reason, though definitely not all!) you've got a pretty reasonable second root of trust.\r\n\r\n> but you are risking significant breakage from misconfiguration which ECH is designed to avoid.\r\n\r\nWhich issues specifically are you concerned about? Presumably the largest issue here would be setting the bit and forgetting it while rotating the ECH key, so I'll assume you meant that.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the retry_configs already offer good key rotation support, so its very possible to do this safely. In general, having this be opt-in largely addresses it - if you're not someone who can do careful key management (eg because this stuff isn't automated between the web server/dns server boundary), you simply won't use it. Naming it something scary also usually helps :).\r\n\r\nWhile DNSSEC suffers from a generally much worse version of this issue (losing your keys or rotating them leaves your zone inoperable, but generally with a much, much, much higher TTL than most modern A/AAAA records for TLS servers), and yet we see incredibly few issues of this sort. This is in part because the idea of this kind of zone-bricking is scary, preventing lots of adoption, but also it causes deployment to generally be very justifiably cautious. With reasonable communication of the potential outcome, engineers managing this stuff get very careful :)\r\n\r\n> If you want to mitigate CA MiTM, I think you need DANE (and DNSSEC) and we shouldn't try to glue a DANE-like mode on to ECH.\r\n\r\nIf web browsers were chomping at the bit to implement DNSSEC verification (or at least check the AD flag), check DANE records, and website admins were chomping at the bit to opt into DNSSEC, I'd probably agree with you. But for many reasons none of those are true, so for the purposes of this discussion I think we'd be much more realistic by assuming DANE didn't exist.",

If we're agreeing that website admins are reluctant to opt in to DNSSEC (let alone DANE), then why do you think opting in to noFallback ECH is going to be likely?\r\n\r\nDNSSEC validation is widely deployed (since it is default in ~every DNS resolver made in the past 20 years). DNSSEC signing of domains is relatively rare, for many reasons (including fear over bricking domains, outdated views of the security of DNSSEC, etc), though seeing some moderate adoption in the email world.\r\n\r\nDANE validation in the browser world has ~0 adoption, for many reasons (the last time we tried DNSSEC did have weaker keys than folks would like, the above DNSSEC-signing fears preventing adoption, system resolvers not exposing the AD flag or TLSA records, trusting ISP DNS resolverss to provide authentication keys, etc, etc). With DoH becoming more popular, the AD flag carries even less meaning than it used to (now you're explicitly trusting a third-party rather than some server presumably operated by even your ISP), so I'm highly doubtful this will change, and not for no reason.\r\n\r\nI'd hope we don't disagree on any of that?\r\n\r\nMany of those issues do not apply to any noFallback ECH - while its conceptually similar DANE (at least when still requiring a CA-signed trusted cert), the avoidance of DNSSEC here provides for a rather huge potential difference in adoption - instead of being forced to opt your entire zone into a potentially-bricking scheme where you have no control over the TTL and you have a whole new set of key material to worry about, this reuses key material you were already going to be adding, allows you to opt in only at the single hostname level, and avoids any of the legacy DNSSEC key insecurity fears, not to mention the debate around DNSSEC operational concerns.\r\n\r\n> More importantly, however, this seems like something that's orthogonal to the purpose of ECH, so I don't think we should make it part of this spec.\r\n\r\nIn the general \"the goal of ECH is to encrypt the client hello\" view, I'd say that's fair. But in the more practical sense that we have now added a DNS-provided key exchange, it seems entirely within the purpose. Not to mention given the simplicity of actually implementing it seems more than worth it? It provides us an opportunity to not just improve privacy on the web with SNI encryption, but also a genuine substantial security improvement with an extra bit and a few conditionals - that seems like it should be more than worth it!\r\n\r\n> Fortunately, ECH supports [extensions](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-15#name-encrypted-clienthello-confi) so it would be straightforward to define an extension for this.\r\n\r\nSadly I think its pretty clear the adoption of such an extension would be a substantial uphill battle. Instead of this security improvement being there on day one, now we have to go through a process of convincing browsers to add an extension, define it as a spec, get that through the IETF process (which in practice some/most? TLS vendors would want to see), etc, etc. Sadly I don't have the substantial time commitment available for such a thing, and given this conversation it sounds like no one else is going to do it :)",

While clients & servers may fall back from TLS1.3 to TLS1.2, they certainly aren't required to. Increasingly few sites support TLS prior to 1.2, and 1.3-required isn't all that wild to see on the open internet.\n\nAny monitoring systems built which relied on null cipher options are increasingly breaking if they intended to work with general TLS, or in fact any MITM appliances which intended to work with all real-world TLS traffic which don't yet support TLS 1.3.\n\nBackwards compatibility on the web is obviously absolutely critical, including through already deployed middleboxes. However, we also move forward. Real-world applications drop support for old protocols - there are several popular TLS libraries that *only* support TLS 1.3. If middleboxes expect to MITM TLS and work with general internet TLS traffic, over the course of protocol adoption lifetimes they have to adapt. Nothing any IETF WG says or does can change that.\n\nLuckily, in this case, adaptation is trivial. If the client is using DoH the same appliance MITMing all TLS is already MITMing DNS, and if not DNS likely the simplest internet protocol to MITM (if they aren't already). Alternatively, any client with software which installed a CA can also trivially disable the enforcement of such a noFallback option - if browser or other TLS client vendors are concerned about adoption with this feature, allowing it to be disabled should address that.\n\nMore generally, your argument applies to *any* change to browser or other client activity which changes to enforce new rules or otherwise behaves differently at all. If such concerns were absolute DANE would be entirely off the table, as would browsers moving automatically to DoH, or even ECH itself. After all, there are many monitoring middleboxes (including on my network!) which read SNI data and can react to it, not to mention that nation state firewalls blocked ESNI when it originally shipped (they may not this time around thanks to GREASE, but there's no guarantee!). I hope we aren't in a world where we can't have nice things :).\n\nAs browsers did with the automated DoH rollout, checking if enforcement breaks connectivity to a sentinel host would allow for seamless fallback on networks on which it results in connection \nfailure.

The compatibility requirement here is just that clients know to skip over mandatory extensions, just like they need to know to skip over unknown codepoints.\r\n\r\nMandatory extensions are very similar to cutting a new top-level version, yes. That's generally true in any protocols. The main difference is in how to coordinate changes. We could have cut extensions out of TLS entirely and simply bumped the version every time we wanted to extend it. (Extension lists were an IETF innovation. SSL 3.0 did not have them and extended by appending to the ClientHello.) Indeed in a protocol from a single vendor, that is probably a better and simpler extensibility strategy. But in the IETF's multi-vendor protocols, it can be useful for extensions to be defined, implemented, and deployed at different rates. Thus, extension lists, with their various semantics on how to handle unknown ones.\r\n\r\nWhether extending ECH rises to this sort of thing being useful, I don't know. But I don't think the question is deployability, nor is the litmus test _simply_ whether it's equivalent to bumping the top-level version. That litmus test would knock out every extension scheme the IETF has ever produced. :-)",

A lot of protocol engineering is trying to get the right thing to happen. Things like critical/mandatory extensions, etc., are tools in our toolbox for getting that right thing to happen. If we're in a context where sometimes we want the older receiver to ignore it, and sometimes we want them to reject it, that's exactly what a mandatory bit is for.\r\n\r\nYou don't see this in TLS only because TLS is a very online protocol, so one side can just say \"I know about this\" and everything flows from there.

Specifically, the Introduction mentions that co-located servers with `consistent externally visible TLS configurations` form an anonymity set. The Security and Privacy Goals section states that `The set of hosts which share the same ECHConfig and TLS configuration is referred to as the anonymity set`. To me there's a subtle difference here in that I understand the `externally visible TLS configurations` is meant to apply to all externally observable behavior, but my impression when just seeing `ECHConfig and TLS configuration` is that these are referring to user-provided TLS configurations which don't encompass all externally observable behavior.\r\n\r\nOne way to fix this is simply to make the phrasing consistent, but I think it would be even nicer to have the term `anonymity set` clearly defined in a single, easily accessible location since it's central to the precise guarantees ECH aims to provide. Maybe it could be explicitly defined in the Conventions and Definitions section? Given a canonical definition, further usages of the anonymity set could just refer to that definition.\r\n\r\nMaybe other significant terms like Client-Facing Server could also be defined in a similar location too?

The entire design of both the recovery flow and GREASE is predicated on this.\r\n\r\nThe recovery flow requires the server handshake with ClientHelloOuter in order to authenticate the retry signal. As a client, we would not be willing to deploy ECH if servers were not required to send a retry signal because it's far too much of a footgun and the end result is users cannot visit sites.\r\n\r\nEven, if we were to make the retry signal optional, this is necessary for GREASE to work. Consider a server transitioning from not deploying ECH to deploying ECH. Because DNS fundamentally may get out of sync with the server, there will be a period of time when the serving endpoint implements ECH, but the client does not realize it. (Cached DNS records, etc.) Such a client will then send ECH GREASE. To the server, ECH GREASE looks like a payload that cannot decrypt with any available ECH key. For such connections to work, the server must handshake with ClientHelloOuter.",

Or the client's local policy may have ECH disabled.\r\n\r\nEven if that client cannot take advantage of ECH, it may still send ECH GREASE to help prevent network ossification.

      "body": "In https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/bvvWbtxJAiMfilfy32EvdaCszQ4/, Elardus Erasmus suggests that the suggestion to limit retries for servers which have rejected ECH is too broad, and we should have different guidance for key/config changes than for just disabling ECH. He also suggests a \"holdoff period\" when connections were disabled.  I do think that this gets at something real, but I'm not sure of the proposed resolution. \r\n\r\nISTM that there are two issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n# Limiting Retries\r\n\r\nIf the server securely disables ECH, then the client should expect a subsequent connection to succeed and there is no way for the server to ask for a retry. So I don't think we need a limit here.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the server supplies a new key, it's possible to get into some kind of loop, for instance, if there are two servers with different keys and the client bounces between them. Rather than suggesting that there be an unspecified limit, I think it would be better just to forbid a connection initiated from a retry_config from itself causing a new connection. That means that if servers are so misconfigured that they offer a retry_config that then doesn't work that they will just fail, but that should be rare, and in any case, you're in deep trouble in that case.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Remembering Retry\r\n\r\nUnless I've misread the text, it implies but doesn't say that the retry_configs and secure disablement are for this connection only and that the client should not use them even for a connection which is initiated immediately after the one where it retries (as in multiple HTTP 1.1 connections). As Erasmus indicates, this increases load on the server as well as latency and has to be balanced with the observation that the retry_configs are a tracking vector (as noted in the text). He suggests a \"holdoff\" where you don't retry ECH if it was securely disabled, but no change in cases where a valid retry_config was provided.\r\n\r\nI wonder if we should be a bit more expansive about this, given that we have other TLS-related tracking vectors that clients already need to mitigate (e.g., resumption) and there are already mechanisms to handle this. With that in mind, how about:\r\n\r\n- Clients should remember updated configuration or disabled ECH for up to the lifetime of the ECHConfig (this also gives some content to \"holdoff\").\r\n- Clients should partition retry_configs in both time and space the same way they would for resumption PSKs (this is something browsers already do).\r\n\r\nAm I missing something important?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

          "body": "There was one third issue, which is how the retry interacts with HTTPS-RR/SVCB's multi-CDN business. That is, if I connected previously and got retry configs, how do I know whether those retry configs apply to the next connection? For all I know, they may have gone through a completely different set of HTTPS-RR/SVCB records.\r\n\r\nAt the time I proposed the retry mechanism, SVCB's design was a little less set yet, and while, as you say, the tracking concerns are actually pretty easy to resolve by saying \"do the same thing you'd do with all other state\", I didn't want to open both of those can of worms at the same time as working through the retry mechanism itself. So my initial proposal just said it was a one-time use, and I figured we could work through all that when/if someone was enthusiastic about remembering them, but the enthusiasm never quite came up.",

          "body": "I think that the multi-CDN scenario is adequately addressed by having the retry only apply to the immediate case.  So it does get harder if you consider what conditions might allow you to reuse that configuration.  Things that seem likely to invalidate that choice:\r\n\r\n* Changes to DNS records (that are invisible to clients).  This is limited by TTL at that layer; people configuring DNS know that they can't rely on propagation for TTL+X (where X is \u311f( \u2594, \u2594 )\u310f more often than not).\r\n* Picking a different DNS RR.  At any stage of the name resolution process.\r\n* Changes to network conditions at the client end. The client might be able to detect this, but not reliably.\r\n* Changes to routing such that a different path is chosen.\r\n* Changes to server deployments. Including servers going down.\r\n\r\nThe sensible thing to do is not to specify anything concrete here, but to explain what might happen that would cause a cached value to become bad, let clients make up their own mind about how long to keep them.\r\n\r\nHowever, if a client uses a retry configuration and it turns out to be bad, I would expect that the server would want to be able to correct it with another retry configuration.  That conflicts with a simpler rule you might write about not accepting retry configurations if the client is using one already.\r\n\r\nSo I see two options here:\r\n\r\n1. Keep things simple and only allow one retry.  If you receive a retry, use it, then discard it.  If you get a retry when you are using a retry, give up.\r\n2. Make things more complex.  A retry configuration can be used for up to some time.  Clients need to limit the time over which they use that according to both their own rules for partitioning state.  They might also consider dropping the value if name resolution cannot produce the same result[^1] or they detect any change to the network conditions.  However, if a retry configuration is used after the first use - or maybe after a minimal period - a client needs to use a retry configuration they get from the server.\r\n\r\nThat last bit is fiddly.  It's something that a server deployment might like to be able to manage with an explicit, TLS-level TTL for a retry configuration.  Also, the whole bit where the first retry is special is going to be very annoying to implement.\r\n\r\n[^1]: This makes certain forms of RR selection design very likely to produce this outcome.  That's OK, because it is a safe failure.  Though it complicates the choice for those who might prefer that sort of deployment, because it now comes with additional costs in the form of the handshakes that Erasmus is suggesting we try to minimize.",

This creates a high likelihood that some clients will decide that `public_name` is not an IP address and pass it into a subsystem that interprets it as an IP address, resulting in a recovery request with no SNI and strange failure modes.  For the sake of consistency in debugging, the authors felt it was preferable to write a simple rule that could be enforced universally.\r\n\r\n> It is a bit sad that ECH currently does not work with a URI that points to an IP address. Especially for the split-mode. But I understand that would be a little more than just ECH/encrypted-SNI.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, that is largely unrelated to the `public_name` question.  If you have a mechanism to associate an ECHConfig with an IP-authenticated TLS connection request, ECH will work fine, although it doesn't seem very useful.  What doesn't work is using an IP certificate in the fallback/recovery flow, since `public_name` cannot be an IP address.\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n>     Additionally, clients MAY ignore the ECHConfig if the length of\r\n>     any label in the DNS name is longer than 63 octets, as this is\r\n>     the maximum length of a DNS label.\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> Why is this a MAY?

Note that any label in a domain name can contain\r\n      any octet value; hostnames are generally considered to be domain\r\n      names where every label follows the rules in the \"preferred name\r\n      syntax\", with the amendment that labels can start with ASCII\r\n      digits (this amendment comes from [Section 2.1 of [RFC1123]](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1123#section-2.1)).\r\n\r\n      People also sometimes use the term \"hostname\" to refer to just the\r\n      first label of an FQDN, such as \"printer\" in\r\n      \"printer.admin.example.com\".  (Sometimes this is formalized in\r\n      configuration in operating systems.)  In addition, people\r\n      sometimes use this term to describe any name that refers to a\r\n      machine, and those might include labels that do not conform to the\r\n      \"preferred name syntax\".\r\n```",

We use `ClientHello` structures directly in ECH structures, but `ClientHello` is one of the structures that DTLS changes. Do we use the DTLS version or the TLS version? The differences are:\r\n\r\n1. The `legacy_version` field is hardcoded to a different value.\r\n2. There is a goofy `legacy_cookie` field.\r\n\r\nThe goofy `legacy_cookie` field is interesting. In principle, it should really should get the same treatment as `legacy_session_id` and be copied over, because there's nothing to hide there. But I think it's actually always empty, since HelloVerifyRequest is banned in DTLS 1.3. But then we probably need to answer dumb questions like:\r\n\r\n1. What happens if a client sends an ECH-ful ClientHello and gets HelloVerifyRequest back?\r\n2. What happens if a server receives an ECH-ful ClientHello but the legacy_cookie field isn't empty?\r\n3. Do we have injectivity problems allowing the two ClientHellos in there? I think we're fine, because `legacy_version` distinguishes the two ClientHellos but, ugh, why oh why did we do this in DTLS??\r\n\r\nNot terribly difficult, but it's ambiguous enough that I think we need to say something here. My inclination is to say that we use the DTLS ClientHello, and pick the least annoying answers for (1) and (2). But I think we do need to write them down somewhere.",

Does it recompute the ECH extension?_ This is the same as the [PSK binders problem](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/tls/HSTgV2voS9tn03oasGmBAdwazWA/). I think we can probably just leave this strategically ambiguous until 9147bis fixes it properly.\r\nc. _How does the client complete the handshake?_ No text needed, it's just the same as any other TLS 1.2 handshake; client completes the handshake with ClientHelloOuter and does its thing.\r\n\r\n> What happens if a server receives an ECH-ful ClientHello but the legacy_cookie field isn't empty?\r\n\r\nNothing special, no text needed. Same thing that happens if the server receives an ECH-ful ClientHello where `legacy_compression_methods` contains random stuff. If it's in ClientHelloOuter, I guess we'll bind it into AAD but otherwise probably ignore it. If it's in ClientHelloInner, the ECH processing code will not care, but the actual handshaking code will then reject it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGiven that, I would suggest, if we can answer the first question in like O(days), let's just do that and avoid the fuss. Since it doesn't really matter either way, I think we can just pick one, informed by what existing implementations, if any (NSS is probably the only possible implementor), might have done.

I have already explained why I think using SHA256 always is not fine. Let me explain why I think sending cipher-suites list in ESNIKeys is not fine.\r\n\r\n@ekr Traditionally, we have allowed different cipher-suites to be selected depending on the value of SNI. This becomes an even more important property in the ESNI proposal, because we split the server into fronting server and hidden server. Cipher-suite selection is a negotiation between the client and the hidden server, whereas the ESNIKeys is a key-exchange between the client and the fronting server.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we cannot / should not use ESNIKeys as a conveyer of cipher-suite negotiation.\r\n\r\nConsidering that we have disagreement on the how we can uses hashes, maybe it is a good idea to merge this as-is to fix the security hole, and get back to do the improvements later on if necessary.

Key generators do not need to care about uniqueness. TLS servers can just look for the matching digest and that's it.\r\n\r\nNote that a server operator can still associate an identifier to the ESNIKeys structure for internal use. The private key will be kept in relation to the structure anyways. So having a private identifier does not complicate things at all.",

Otherwise, CDNs cannot starting ESNI for any domains until all their customers permit the use ESNI.\r\n\r\nI think this should be possible with either approach.\r\nIn the non-prefixed case, the CDN can offer a dedicated CNAME target that has both the A/AAAA records of the ESNI enabled TLS servers and the ESNI records to use with them. If the customer doesn't want ESNI enabled, they can use the non-ESNI CNAME target. Or for CDN providers that offer a CNAME target personalized to the customer, this could be handled by a configuration at the CDN provider level.\r\nIn the prefixed case, it's of course a matter of the customer adding an _esni CNAME record pointing to the CDN's ESNI record.",

      "body": "(WG email coming shortly.)\r\n\r\nCloses #82.\r\n\r\nESNI has different compatibility characteristics than most TLS\r\nextensions. It involves client state, and encrypting the SNI makes the\r\nClientHello unusable for servers that do not have the key or do not\r\nimplement ESNI. This breaks common rollout and rollback strategies and\r\nplaces strong requirements on DNS/server consistency. This makes\r\ndeploying ESNI risky for servers.\r\n\r\nThis change aims to reduce these deployment risks. ESNI is much more\r\nuseful if widely deployed. Moreover, if ESNI is unreliable due to\r\ncomplex requirements on the server, clients will be disincentivized to\r\nimplement it. The DNS/server consistency requirements also\r\ndisincentivize rotating keys (section 7.2.5).\r\n\r\nThis change introduces the notion of a \"public name\" which allows the\r\nclient to receive authenticated signals from the server that the\r\nESNIKeys are out of sync, so clients can safely repair key mismatches.\r\nIt also aligns with existing server behavior before ESNI, so partial\r\nrollouts and rollbacks can also be handled.\r\n\r\nThe fix for the latter also handles MITM scenarios, replacing the\r\nexisting client recommendation:\r\n\r\n>   A Web client client can securely detect case (2) because it will\r\n>   result in a connection which has an invalid identity (most likely)\r\n>   but which is signed by a certificate which does not chain to a\r\n>   publicly known trust anchor.  The client can detect this case and\r\n>   disable ESNI while in that network configuration.\r\n>\r\n>   https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-tls-esni-02#section-6.2\r\n\r\nThe public name notion fixes a bug in that text: an attacker could\r\ndisable ESNI on all servers, given the existence of *any* such server.",

              "body": "It's just the former, yeah.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the text is to prevent resumption/SNI mismatches. With ESNI and, in particular, this ESNI to SNI fallback, a client offering {(non-GREASE) ESNI, SNI, PSK} now needs to consider all four possible responses:\r\n\r\n1. Server ACK'd ESNI and did full handshake\r\n2. Server ACK'd ESNI and resumed PSK\r\n3. Server ignored ESNI (thus used SNI) and did full handshake\r\n4. Server ignored ESNI (thus used SNI) and resumed PSK\r\n\r\nIn particular, whether the server ACKs or ignores ESNI determines which name the server believes it is acting on behalf of. So we want that to be consistent with the identity the client has associated with the PSK, if any. (1) and (3) are vacuously self-consistent, so that's easy.\r\n\r\nAs for (2) and (4), presumably the client would not be offering a session good for the public name because it's actually trying to connect to the ESNI name. Thus we want to reject (4) and allow (2). (If we allow (4), then the verify-public-name section needs to decide whether this weird scenario counts as authenticating the replacement ESNI keys and that's weird.) That means the server needs to know not the produce (4).\r\n\r\nNow, we could that, if a server ignores the ESNI extension due to key mismatch, it should also ignore the PSK extension. That works, except:\r\n* We want to be robust to server rollbacks and partial deployments. Such a server won't know to ignore the PSK extension.\r\n* Being able to send GREASE extensions is nice and a GREASE client wants to accept (4) since all the names are actually identical all around.\r\n\r\nOur thinking was to instead take leaf out of EMS's (and new TLS versions in general) book and partitions the connection/resumption space by whether ESNI was used. We remember a bit in the session state for whether ESNI was used when establishing it. We then say that a client offering ESNI [for real, not GREASE] can only offer ESNI-ful sessions, and a server can only accept ESNI-ful sessions in ESNI-ful handshakes.\r\n\r\nThis gives all the properties we want:\r\n* Clients offering ESNI will only offer an ESNI-ful session, which is invalid for the server to accept if it declined ESNI. Thus it can reject (4) above.\r\n* This can work with ESNI-oblivious servers on rollback. The server makes the ESNI bit in the session state unparseable by older versions of itself. This is the same sort of thing the server would already have had to do for EMS, or TLS 1.3.\r\n* Clients offering GREASE ESNI will almost always offer ESNI-less sessions (last time I talked to the server, it presumably didn't have ESNI either). The server will decline ESNI (since it's random noise), which means it's allowed to resume ESNI-less sessions.\r\n\r\nThere isn't an immediate need to constrain ESNI-less sessions, so I didn't in this version of the text. Though maybe a full partition is cleaner? It also occurs to me I have no idea what to do about external PSKs. We could say that if you really want ESNI + external PSK (strange considering that ESNI is usually about picking a certificate anyway...), you have to associate an ESNI bit with the EPSK?? EPSKs are a really underspecified use case that I don't know how to evaluate it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've tweaked the text slightly and left the above questions as-is for now. Is the new text clearer? / Thoughts on the above?",

If we were worried about a malicious server colluding with a network observer, that malicious server could already just broadcast whatever tracking information it has to the clear somewhere else. :-P\r\n\r\nBut if the client is already not bothering with session resumption or scoping it for tracking reasons, a single-use retry means they don't *also* need to scope this. Honestly, saying that you must scope this at least as tightly as session resumption probably is sufficient? Though there's also thinking through accidental pinning if retry keys manage to change the public name.\r\n\r\nI added \"pinning concerns\" to the text but I dunno what other text is needed given the above. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n(Neither of these are obviously fatal. There is a corner of the design space around in-band provisioning of ESNI keys, if we're okay caching these and can stomach the complexity of an in-band retry. I know some folks on the list were interested in that. But I think it makes sense to focus on the simplest version of the idea first.)",

(GitHub's UI is... not the best).\r\n\r\n> \"If none of the values provided in \"retry_keys\" contains a version supported by the client, the client MUST consider the server to have disabled ESNI.\"\r\n\r\nI tweaked the wording a bit based on the first part. It seemed better to adjust the surrounding text too. Re the second part, I'm not sure what \"[MUST consider](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6919#section-2)\" would mean as a normative requirement...\r\n\r\n> What the client does in response to an authenticated signal that disables ESNI is a matter for client policy, so the SHOULD is inappropriate.\r\n\r\nThe text around unechoed extensions also uses SHOULD. It's true that there isn't a single \"hook point\" for client policy around the disabling bit. It sounds like you might prefer a more \"abstracted\" text where something first outputs \"secure disable\", or \"secure replace\" and then there's policy on that.\r\n\r\nI haven't done that yet, in part because it's late on a Friday, but also I think we're well into wordsmithing weeds now. :-) I don't know what the right document organization would be for that. Also it's getting pretty long. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n> BTW, this would argue for having a third option: esni_disabled.\r\n\r\nIt's already there by way of not echoing the extension. I think a separate explicit version would only make sense if there are clients who:\r\n* are happy with `esni_retry_requested`\r\n* would be happy with `esni_disabled`\r\n* are *not* happy with the unechoed signal.\r\n\r\nThat preference is not entirely implausible because not echoing the extension is an implicit signal repurposing existing server behavior. However, that's also kind of the point, since it allows safe rollback. If server deployments cannot rely on that, the cost of deploying ESNI goes up dramatically.\r\n\r\nESNI, even more so than most TLS improvements, really wants a wide deployment, so I think it's good for the document to have a strong opinion here.\r\n\r\n(Specialized clients and specialized servers, of course, would probably ignore disable signals, but they would ignore `esni_disabled` too, so that's more about the SHOULD. But it seems to me that's covered by \"there may exist valid reasons in particular circumstances to ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and carefully weighed before choosing a different course\".)",

I'd be concerned that omission of a digest might lead to availability concerns.\r\n\r\nThe reason we have had `record_digest` is because the TLS handshake used to always hard-fail when client uses a corrupt ESNI record. With #124 being merged, we have a fallback mechanism that would work in _some_ failure modes without the need for the digest. However, I believe that there are still certain cases of hard failure (like the server sending an `illegal_parameter` alert) when the ESNI record is corrupt.\r\n\r\nPS. Therefore I think I might favor the approach proposed by @davidben in #150: place the IP address list outside of the ESNIKeys.",

Take for example the case of a server that has published only one key: trial decryption then is no more expensive that decryption directed by a specific checksum, which the adversary can learn from the DNS record. So an obvious mitigation in case of stress is to only trial one of the published keys, possibly the latest, or a randomly chosen one.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should point out the directed DOS attack -- for example, an adversary could bomb a forwarding server with repeated connection request. But then, that's not much more potent than repeated non-ESNI connection requests.",

The reasons are as follows.\r\n\r\nThe benefit of the proposed change is that it frees client from buffering the content of the ESNI extension (after encryption), when using a building block that does not support reusing the same public key pair. Though, we might argue that even with this change, clients might still want to buffer the extension for possible retransmission rather than doing another public key operation in case of receiving a HRR.\r\n\r\nThe downside of the proposed change is that it might require the server to do another public key operation when verifying the ESNI extension found in ClientHello being sent in response to HelloRetryRequest. Current design, by requiring the keys to be identical, allows a server to validate the indifference of the ESNI extension without actually deciphering the payload.\r\n\r\nOne of the role of HRR is to mitigate attacks. When under attack, I believe that servers would be reluctant to do an additional public key operation. Therefore, to me it seems that the proposed change would incentivize the server to skip the verification of the ESNI extension sent in response to HRR.\r\n\r\nComparing the benefit and the downside, my weak preference goes to retaining the design as-is, because as I stated, I think that clients would be (mostly) fine with the design, and under the assumption that it is beneficial to encourage servers to validate the ESNI extension sent in response to HRR.",

Then, when it receives a HelloRetryRequest, it would retransmit the buffered payload of the ESNI extension.",

(It really would be cleaner if we just stuffed something into the key schedule, but then the client needs to trial-decrypt or we need a cleartext \"yes, I used ESNI\" signal.)\r\n\r\nFor completeness, deployments which allow different services to have different version, cipher, or group preferences need to process ESNI on the first ClientHello because resolving HRR requires those preferences. Of course, services with different preferences will partition the anonymity sets a little bit, but enough deployments expect to be able to vary TLS parameters this way that I think we need to allow for this. (BoringSSL, for instance, resolves SNI on the first ClientHello.)\r\n\r\n**Split mode**\r\n\r\nOn that note, split mode and HRR are a little messy. Possibilities I can see:\r\n\r\n1. Dispatch happens at second ClientHello. Frontend and backend must agree on HRR-sensitive parameters, and backend gets a handshake transcript from the frontend.\r\n2. Dispatch happens at first ClientHello, but frontend and backend agree on enough of TLS parameters that frontend can sniff HelloRetryRequest + second ClientHello (technically a [protocol invariant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8446#section-9.3) violation) to check the ESNI.\r\n3. Backend and frontend both have ESNI keys. This contradicts #169.\r\n\r\n**Near-attack**\r\n\r\nFinally, I think there's one more issue here with changing the key share which, while not fatal, is rather a headache. Suppose we went with this PR. Here is a near-attack:\r\n\r\n1. Attacker observes an ESNI-ful HRR-ful connection. Let CH1 and CH2 be the first and second ClientHellos.\r\n2. Attacker wants to determine if CH1/CH2's ESNI contained hostname H. (It can repeat this process with different guesses.)\r\n3. Attacker makes a connection to the server. It replays CH1 and gets an HRR.\r\n4. Attacker sends its own second ClientHello with its own key shares and an ESNI record containing H.\r\n5. If H matched CH1's ESNI, the server will accept the connection and continue. If it mismatched, the server will fail with an alert.\r\n\r\nThis is only a near-attack because ClientESNIInner contains a nonce the attacker cannot guess, so even if it matched the hostname, it cannot match the nonce. But this means the server must perform the comparison in constant-time (attacker can repeat steps 3-5 all it wants) and the nonce is even more load-bearing in a subtle way.\r\n\r\nExample of subtlety: In both \"server must check CH2\" PRs, it is easy for the server to ignore it and no one notices. One could imagine saying the ESNI nonce must change in CH2, so the server *at least* doesn't ignore it. But that would turn this near-attack into an actual attack. Whereas I believe the same-key version avoids all of this.\r\n\r\n**Changing the key schedule**\r\n\r\nIt seems we're in this mess because we've bound ESNI to the handshake in a roundabout way rather than injecting the key into the key schedule. I believe this originally was to aid split mode, but we've since added this nonce anyway, so having frontend pass the key schedule addition into the backend is plausible. Perhaps this is worth reconsidering? Some thoughts:\r\n\r\nFirst, there isn't a slot in the key schedule for this. I think that's fine though, as long as we change the label. Here's one possibility:\r\n\r\n```\r\n             0\r\n             |\r\n             v\r\n   PSK ->  HKDF-Extract = Early Secret\r\n             |\r\n             +-----> Derive-Secret(...)\r\n             |                     = binder_key\r\n             |                     = client_early_traffic_secret\r\n             |                     = early_exporter_master_secret\r\n             v\r\n       Derive-Secret(., \"derived\", \"\")\r\n             |\r\n             v\r\n   (EC)DHE -> HKDF-Extract\r\n             |\r\n             v\r\n       Derive-Secret(., \"esni nonce\", \"\")\r\n             |\r\n             v\r\nESNI nonce -> HKDF-Extract = Handshake Secret\r\n             |\r\n             +-----> Derive-Secret(...)\r\n             |                     = client_handshake_traffic_secret\r\n             |                     = server_handshake_traffic_secret\r\n             v\r\n            ...\r\n ```\r\n(Arguably all the \"derived\" labels should have had names.)\r\n\r\nThe second issue is how to signal it on the client. I see two options:\r\n\r\n1. Cleartext signal in ServerHello. This violates \"do not stick out\" and makes the GREASE extensions totally useless.\r\n2. The client computes both server_handshake_traffic_secret values and trial-decrypts to figure out which one to use. This is trial decryption and non-destructive trial-decryption at that, so it's rather a headache. (On the plus side, it only needs to be done on the first handshake record.)\r\n\r\nNeither of these is very satisfactory but, then again, nor are our other two options. :-/\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\nEverything is a mess.",

The server certificate needs to be padded regardless, so the server already needs to make decisions based on the length distributions of known hostnames.\r\n\r\nSecond, it dramatically increases the complexity of deploying ESNI. In the existing design, the actual certificate lookup on the server is relatively unchanged. The TLS library could even abstract much of the name lookup, public name fallback, etc., from the application by simply passing the name along the same interface as before and leave that portion unchanged. This design forces the server to have a new digest-based path, which extends throughout the entire configuration pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe `label_limit` notion for dealing with wildcards is also another source of stateful deployment problems with configuration mismatches. Perhaps I used to use a wildcard cert, but now I'd like to switch to individual subdomains. This transition is difficult under this PR. For more fun, the folks managing the names may be different from the folks who implemented ESNI, so the deployment concern will go unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe wildcard cert scheme is also messy with protocols that do not have their own in-band vhosting mechanism and just use TLS. HTTP doesn't care about HTTP has a Host header, so it doesn't actually care about the SNI. (I will observe, however, that the Host header should probably trigger padding too, so we're still back to square one. :-) )",

The purpose of \"SHOULD ignore\" is to ensure that DNS-based load balancing of A/AAAA on SvcDomainName continues to work correctly.

I believe [one of our experiments](https://www.imperialviolet.org/2018/04/11/pqconftls.html) suggested the additional cost is roughly linear to the number of bytes.\r\n\r\nWe could encrypt some sort of \"delta ClientHello\", either saying \"copy these extensions from the outside\" or something hilarious scheme where you specify a sequence of new bytes and references into your outer ClientHello... (I think the former is easier to send while the latter is easier to receive.)\r\n\r\nAnother thought, though it requires a side channel from frontend to backend, is the `ClientHelloInner` omits `key_shares` in favor of a new `key_shares_hashed` extension where you insert `SHA256(ClientHelloOuter.key_shares)` for transcript purposes. The receiver then asserts the hash matches and pretends you included `ClientHelloOuter.key_shares` in `ClientHelloInner` for handshake purposes.",

The rationale here would be that the only purpose of ClientHelloOuter is to enable the fallback handshake, and so those keys are just protecting the SNI (and ESNIConfig, but that's just there to protect SNI), and we could potentially live with that being non-quantum-safe, especially if we're not going to use PQ algorithms for ESNI encryption. And of course if we *do* use PQ algorithms for ESNI encryption, then the overhead of the second CH is only about 1/2 as opposed to double.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

You could imagine a ClientHello-specific compression that knows how to toss extensions around (in which case, yeah, it starts getting closer to ESNI transformation), or some more generic delta encoding.

But it's harder to decode since you need to add checks for silly questions like \"what order do I insert extensions?\" or \"what happens if the placeholder is missing\" or \"what happens if there are two placeholders?\" or \"what happens if the outer ClientHello is missing the extension to copy?\".\r\n\r\nConversely, though it may take more spec text to describe, a bytes-based encoding is easier to decode since you just blindly evaluate the two opcodes and only need to include a couple of checks. But it's harder to encode since you need to account for length prefixes when chopping things up.",

If interested here's the [diff](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/compare/master...sftcd:encch) and [some notes](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/blob/encch/esnistuff/echo.md) on what I did.\r\n\r\nDoing that was fairly messy but not that hard, the main thoughts/questions I was left with were:\r\n- <strike>it'd maybe be easier to have the ESNI-specific padding in the esni-nonce extension directly as that'd mean less change to OpenSSL API behaviour (applications can set callbacks to do padding themselves too)</strike> In the end, I added a CH padding extension to the inner CH, (sort of) as envisaged in the PR, but could as easily do the padding within the esni_nonce. Still not sure if there're any API issues. The ``padded_length`` field in the ESNIConfig is now (IMO) even more of a bad plan than before as the relevant thing to pad is the entire plaintext inner CH and not just the server_name - so whomever is writing values to the DNS has even less likelihood of knowing a good exact max/value. (And it can be >260 now too.)\r\n - I took a stab at using my OpenSSL code for [HPKE](https://github.com/sftcd/happykey) instead of the ESNI-specific stuff that's been in earlier drafts and that wasn't a problem (though I didn't spend time thinking about how exactly to use HPKE - I just set the TLS session key share as the AAD)\r\n- I'm still very unclear as to what rules should/must apply to the relationship between values in the inner and outer CH's - but the simpler we can make that the better (I don't mean compression here, just what rules are to apply when we have two versions of a thing, like the TLS session key share or ALPN for example)\r\n- For ALPN, I implemented support for different values in inner and outer CH, which was easy enough and could even be possibly useful:-) One upshot of that is that it more or less means that the server really ought also do record layer padding of the EncryptedExtensions as otherwise the length of that might give the game away where values like ALPN differ between inner and outer CH.\r\n\r\nAnd just in case: I didn't try any compression and this code is likely flakey as hell in error cases, so don't anyone go using it for anything:-) I plan to ditch it anyway once draft-06 is out.",

      "body": "[This PR sits on top of #198. Ignore the first commit to look at it in isolation.]\r\n\r\nWe currently have two levels of mechanisms for servers to advertise multiple sets of parameters. First, each ESNIConfig has multiple keys in it, so a server can suport multiple groups at once. These keys are stapled together so a single HTTPSSVC record, etc., delivers the entire configuration.\r\n\r\nAt a layer above that, we have a version/extension-based mechanism. The server may advertise multiple ESNIConfigs to cover multiple versions of ESNI (hopefully we won't need this mechanism after standardization, but it's quite useful for draft versions) or multiple sets of mandatory extensions. Unlike the group advertisement, these are each in separate configuration units, so, e.g., they may be in multiple HTTPSSVC records.\r\n\r\nThis PR flattens the two mechanisms into one. Each ESNIConfig now has a single KeyShareEntry. Multiple groups and multiple versions are expressed in the same way: multiple ESNIConfig structures. It then introduces a wrapper ESNIConfigs structure which is the new unit of ESNI configuration delivered in HTTPSSVC, etc.\r\n\r\nThis should be paired with a change to draft-nygren-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc to carry an ESNIConfigs, not an ESNIConfig (formerly ESNIKeys). (@bemasc FYI)\r\n\r\nThis fixes a number of oddities:\r\n\r\n- Client and server need to maintain two levels of configuration. On the server, the structure has two layers of lists, something like list(tuple(ESNIConfig, list(PrivateKey))). Now the server maintains list(tuple(ESNIConfig, PrivateKey)). Conversely, the client needed two negotiation loops whereas now it only requires one.\r\n\r\n- Logic across different layers of the client stack now more reliably have the full ESNI configuration available in one unit.\r\n\r\n  In the old design, a single ESNIConfig, rather than a set of them, would be correlated with an IP address or CNAME, by way of the HTTPSSVC record. A server which supportsed multiple ESNI versions or mandatory extension sets would advertise several HTTPSSVC records, potentially with different IPs. That means the DNS and transport connection logic must know about TLS capabitilies to pick the right HTTPSSVC record.\r\n\r\n  In the new design, the server includes all its variations at once, so the DNS and transport logic can reasonably pick an HTTPSSVC purely based on whether the TLS stack supports ESNI, rather than the full set of capabilities. That is, the text in [0] does not work right now, and this PR fixes it.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that, in the likely case that the server only supports one version and one set of extensions, the non-key ESNI config bits (notably the public name; the rest is small) are repeated for every named group. However, the public name should not be that large and servers should only need one or two groups[1].\r\n\r\nThis also does make ESNIConfigs and ESNIConfig separate structures, which is slightly goofy. Alternate names if folks prefer:\r\n\r\n- ESNIConfig/ESNIConfigs => ESNIConfig/ESNIBundle\r\n- ESNIConfig/ESNIConfigs => ESNIKey/ESNIConfig\r\n\r\n[0] https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nygren-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc-00#section-8.1.1\r\n[1] https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/05/16/agility.html",

Ignore the first commit to look at it in isolation.]\r\n\r\nWe have two levels of mechanisms for servers to advertise parameters. Each ESNIConfig has multiple keys, so a server can suport multiple groups at once. These keys are stapled together so a single HTTPSSVC record delivers the entire configuration.\r\n\r\nThen we have a versions/extensions mechanism. A server supporting multiple versions of ESNI or multiple sets of mandatory extensions must advertise multiple ESNIConfigs. Unlike the group advertisement, these require separate HTTPSSVC records. This means the full ESNI config is not reliably available to logic across different layers of the client stack. In particular, the HTTPSSVC spec text in [0] does not work. (@bemasc FYI)\r\n\r\nCurrently, a single ESNIConfig, rather than a set of them, is correlated with an IP address or CNAME, by way of the HTTPSSVC record. A server which supports multiple ESNI versions or mandatory extension sets must advertise several HTTPSSVC records, potentially with different IPs. DNS and transport logic must know TLS capabilities to pick the right HTTPSSVC record.\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces an ESNIConfigs structure which advertises a list of ESNIConfig structures. The ESNIConfigs is the new unit of ESNI configuration. This should be paired with a change to draft-nygren-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc to carry an ESNIConfigs, not an ESNIConfig (formerly ESNIKeys).\r\n\r\nNow the server can include the full config at once, so the DNS and transport logic can reasonably pick an HTTPSSVC purely based on whether the TLS stack supports ESNI, rather than the full set of capabilities. This fixes the text in [0].\r\n\r\nThat ESNIConfigs and ESNIConfig are separate structures is slightly goofy naming. Alternate names if folks prefer:\r\n\r\n- ESNIConfig/ESNIConfigs => ESNIConfig/ESNIBundle\r\n\r\n- ESNIConfig/ESNIConfigs => ESNIKeys/ESNIConfig\r\n  (Nuisance: an ESNIConfig is a list of ESNIKeyses, which brings back the double plural.)\r\n\r\n(While I'm here, fix the remnants of ESNIKeyShares. I'll split that out if this PR is controversial, but GitHub is really bad at dependent PRs, so I've left it together for now.)\r\n\r\n[0] https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nygren-dnsop-svcb-httpssvc-00#section-8.1.1",

Ignore the first two comments to look at it in isolation.]\r\n\r\nWe have two layers of parameter negotiation. Multiple KeyShareEntry values in an ESNIConfig, and multiple ESNIConfig values in an ESNIConfigs. We only need one mechanism, so store only one KeyShareEntry in an ESNIConfig.\r\n\r\nThis simplifies representing client and server configuration, which simplies implementation internals as well as interchange formats. Right now, on the server, configuration has two layers of lists, something like list(tuple(ESNIConfig, list(PrivateKey))). Now the server maintains list(tuple(ESNIConfig, PrivateKey)).\r\n\r\nNote also that draft-farrell-tls-pemesni-00 has this oddity around what to do if the ESNIKeys contains multiple keys. This is particularly a nuisance because a single standalone PRIVATE KEY / ESNIKEY pair is not usable because the server has committed to answering to *all* keys in the ESNIKeys. The server must consume multiple PEM files, match up the ESNIKeyses, and then assert that it has a complete set.\r\n\r\nThe downside is that, in the likely case that the server only supports one version and one set of extensions, the non-key ESNI config bits (notably the public name; the rest is small) are repeated for every named group. However, the public name should not be that large and servers should only need one or two groups (see https://www.imperialviolet.org/2016/05/16/agility.html).",

Many (most?) server\nECHOConfig instances will make use of default settings.\nThose'll pick 254 because adding a new VirtualHost to\nan apache instance (or similar) won't be co-ordinated\nwith making a new ECHOConfig in general.

We disagree. But what do you think the client should\ndo? Draft-06 is IMO plainly incorrect in that it says to\npad in a way that'd expose other lengths should those be\nsensitive. If your answer were pad the SNI to at least\nECHOConfig.maximum_name_length and then make the overall\na multiple of 16, with as many added 16 octets blocks as\nthe client chooses, then a) that's != draft-06 and b) is\nquite close to this PR and c) just failing if the actual\nSNI in the inner CH is longer than the config setting\nseems quite wrong to me and d) hardcodes the assumption\nthat SNI is the only thing where the server may know\nbetter.\n\nCheers,\nS.\n\n\n> \n",

It seems they still need to come up with a random value or a default, but now it's even less clear how to set it well.\r\n\r\n>> I think it thus makes sense to target a different\r\n>> maximum here.\r\n>\r\n> Then it can't be the max:-) The 254 value matches the\r\n> max for server_name IIRC.\r\n\r\nEr, yes, sorry I meant to say target a different public length. That is, 254 is so far from the maximum domain name in practice (As it should be! Hard length limits ought to be comfortably away from the actual requirement.), so padding up to it is wasteful. I think it would be better to pad up to a tighter value and, if we exceed it, accept that we only have the fallback multiple of 16 padding. (Or maybe a different strategy.) It does result in smaller anonymity sets in edge cases, but I think that a reasonable default tradeoff given other desires like broader deployment and not wasting too much of users' data.\r\n\r\n> Ok.

For each field, determine how much it makes sense to pad given what kinds of things it sends. If it varies ALPN, maybe round up to the largest of those. Most of this can be determined without server help.\r\n2. For fields where server help is useful, like the name, apply that help. Right now it's simply a `max` function. I'm also open to other strategies.\r\n3. Sum all that padding together.\r\n4. In order to generally reduce entropy across different kinds of clients, maybe apply some additional overall padding, like rounding up to a multiple of 16, which cuts down the state space by 16x and doesn't cost much. (Or maybe we should round up to the nearest `int(64 * 1.1**i)`? That avoids higher resolution on longer values while bounding the fraction of bytes wasted by this step.) That said, it's worth keeping in mind that clients already vary quite a bit in the cleartext portions of the ClientHello. There's a bit of tension between wanting to look like the other clients and wanting to ship new security improvements.\r\n\r\nThis is different from this PR because this PR asks the server to report a value including things it doesn't know anything about (how large the client-controlled parameters are). I don't quite follow (c). It seems this PR and the above proposal has roughly the same failure modes when something is too long. The difference is that `maximum_name_length`'s failure mode is only tripped on particular long names (something the server knows the distribution of), while this PR's equivalent failure mode is based on factors outside the server control, yet the server is responsible for the value.",

          "body": "I think that this approach is generally better, but it runs afoul of divergence in client configuration that could dominate the calculation.  For instance, a client that sends two key shares will have very different padding requirements to one that sends only one.  For that to work, we need to assume that implementation-/deployment-specific variation of the inner CH is largely eliminated as a result of the compression scheme we adopt.  That also assumes that these variations in client behaviour are not privacy-sensitive.  \r\n\r\nI think that we should be directly acknowledging those assumptions if that is indeed the case.\r\n\r\nIf there is a significant variation in size due to client-specific measures, then we're in a bit of an awkward position.  That might render any similarly simple scheme ineffective.  For instance, a client that later supports a set of ALPN identifiers that could vary in length depending on context cannot use this signal directly. It has to apply its own logic about the padding of that extension.  That a client is doing this won't be known to a server that deploys this today. In that case, the advice from the server (which knows most about the anonymity set across which it is hoping to spread the resulting CH), isn't going to be forced through an additional filter at the client.  The results are unlikely to be good without a great deal of care.",

Restricting them to come only from the ECHOConfig seems unnecessary.\r\n\r\nI think the key observation in this PR is that the outer ClientHello isn't _really_ offering to establish a TLS connection -- it's a not-crazy-looking wrapper for the actual ClientHello inside the ECHO extension, and the vehicle for the recovery flow.  The only things a server can legitimately do are respond to the inner ClientHello or do a recovery handshake.  Thus, most of the things you might set on the outer ClientHello are irrelevant; they can be chosen to look innocuous, chosen at random, or copied from the inner ClientHello as the implementation chooses.",

Possibly even with some client state for subsequent connections, though squaring that with multi-CDN is tricky.\r\n\r\nThat sort of thing came up on the list, but IIRC folks weren't very excited about the complexity involved and we kept it as a simpler, recovery-only story.",

There's apparently no value in specifying how the client gets this number, only the properties that it needs to have (i.e. that an observer can't predict it).  If an implementation wants to use an exporter as a source of entropy, that breaks nothing, but any source of entropy will do.\r\n\r\nThe exporter seems primarily useful in the case where one side generates the value and the other side verifies it, which is another way to spell this approach.  It makes the server implementation marginally more complex, though, and I think the echo-or-random spelling is fine.\r\n\r\n> > My preference would be to give it a non-ECH-related name (e.g. \"client_hello_id\"), and require that servers not validate the contents.

It appears in SH and echoes the value from the inner. It appears in EE and contains fallback info.\r\n\r\nI apologize for the lack of clarity. As @MikeBishop suggested, we should add a table that summarizes all of this information. Perhaps something like this:\r\n\r\n  | Message     | Payload type                            |\r\n  |-----------------|------------------------------------------|\r\n  | outer CH     | ClientECH (contains inner CH) |\r\n  | inner CH     | ECHNonce (random number) |\r\n  | SH              | ECHNonce (echoes inner CH on accept; random number on reject) |\r\n  | EE              | ServerECH (contains retry config) |   \r\n\r\n\r\n> But this still has `ech_nonce` defined, and relatively unchanged. So I'm now completely lost.\r\n\r\nAs I've said, I've been trying to keep changes to \"ech_nonce\" out of this PR. We could overload it by having the SH echo the payload of \"ech_nonce\", as you suggest; but this is a significant change to that extension's semantics. In particular, to mitigate the attack described in [Section 10.9.1](https://tlswg.org/draft-ietf-tls-esni/draft-ietf-tls-esni.html#name-client-reaction-attack-miti), the payload of \"ech_nonce\" needs to be kept secret. This would not be the case if it were echoed in the SH.\r\n\r\nTaking a step back, there's the larger question of whether \"ech_nonce\" is redundant. In particular, if the inner CH.random is independent from the outer CH.random, then the inner CH.random serves the same purpose as the \"ech_nonce\" extension. (See the discussion of issue #253.)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us to options: leave \"ech_nonce\" out of this PR and consider removing it later; or re-purpose \"ech_nonce\" for this PR. I'd be happy with either, but the latter needs to be discussed in the context of #253.\r\n\r\n> (I'm pretty sure that we will need to write a bunch of new code to handle the inner/outer split, but our extension handling code definitely won't like having the same extension in both inner and outer.)\r\n\r\nSomething to keep in mind is that ClientHelloInner is \"synthetic\" in the sense that it doesn't ever appear as a handshake message on the wire. It's consumed by the client-facing server in Shared Mode and used to construct a real ClientHello in Split Mode. Hence, the \"ech\" extension is only offered *on the wire* in CH, SH, and EE.\r\n\r\n",

Otherwise, there's attacks ranging from the key shares to simply replacing the cipher suite list with garbage. (If the server responds, the server must not have looked at the outer cipher suite.)\r\n* Switch decryption failure to fallback rather than error (#290), otherwise the attacker could perturb the ciphertext and see if the server noticed.\r\n\r\nThen there's whether the attacker is allowed to compare config_ids in two connections, or look up and recognize the particular server's ECH config. For example, if you do a DNS lookup or just trigger the retry flow, you can learn the expected config_id and look for it. The trial decryption option or #177 could work. From there, there's still recognizing the public name from the queried ECH config. (Though that depends on whether the public name is one you'd expect in normal traffic or not.)",

You could define a new struct or a type alias.\r\n\r\nSorry to go back on forth on this point. I'm not sure what the better choice is.",

Most extensions don't actually benefit from being sent twice because they're the same across every connection made by that client. Even an empty extension costs four bytes normally and (marginally) costs two bytes compressed. Shrinking the ciphertext not only saves bytes for ECH ClientHellos, but it makes it cheaper to add GREASE to non-ECH ClientHellos.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I agree with your conclusion:\r\n\r\n>  If all we have is KeyShare, then I think requiring things to be contiguous is good enough, in that if we end up with CompressibleExtension2 in future people can just serialize it next to KeyShare.\r\n\r\nThe only extension with an ordering constraint is PSK, which would never be compressed anyway. The client can fiddle with the order as needed to compress the extensions it wants to compress.\r\n\r\n> Sorry, brain fart. This isn't closed by a solution to #323.\r\n\r\n#323 might open up a few more options by removing inner_digest, like including multiple outer_extensions if you want to compress multiple runs of extensions. (I think that was an earlier design?) That said, I agree with @ekr that the ordering thing isn't a big deal.",

The current draft says you don't follow the RFC8446 rules, but that can't be right because we need the cookie to appear in CHOuter even if CHOuter can't be constructed.\r\n3. Even if a mismatch is allowed, I think we should have text encouraging a match, so implementers know to avoid a complexity cliff if they don't need it.\r\n\r\n(It's also possible this would interact with #333, if we want some goofy HRRInner vs HRROuter scheme...)",

This pull request is phrased differently in terms of what might cause a server to send HRR, which isn't that.  The HRR is the only thing that a client should allow to change its preferences, but focus on HRR seems wrong.\r\n\r\nTo avoid problems we have two options: the preference cannot change (which is the ideal choice if we can manage it), or the preference can change, but any change is authenticated.  To that end, this is a reasonable design choice, I just would prefer we concentrate on the critical property.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm fairly sure that this means that 8446 needs to be updated by this.",

This is recognizing a new constraint on the design that was essentially always true, but not mandatory.  In principle, prior to this, HRR could affect a new extension that didn't affect key negotiation.\r\n\r\nConveniently, we already have a proxy for that.  Extensions that are CH/SH (as opposed to CH/EE) are those that HRR can change.  In theory there could be some that appear in CH alone, but that is unlikely to be true for a new extension given our systemic rejection of trial decryption.\r\n\r\nThis should probably be reflected somewhere, probably by updating RFC 8446.",

The one I have in mind is this:\r\nhttps://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/issues/233#issuecomment-697949177\r\n\r\nHelloRetryRequest contains the cipher suite. If, as a client, you have different cipher suite preferences in ClientHelloOuter and ClientHelloInner, the set of valid HRR messages varies. The same is true if you have different supported_groups or key_shares preferences. That means it is possible to receive a HelloRetryRequest that is valid for ClientHelloInner, but not ClientHelloOuter, and vice versa. The client needs to do something coherent in that case. Specifically...\r\n\r\n* It needs to note that one of the parallel handshake flows has an error, but not act on it yet.\r\n* When it sees ServerHello, if the server picked the ClientHello with a deferred error, it needs to retroactively act on that error.\r\n* If HRR was good for inner but bad for outer, the client needs to send a second ClientHello with an updated ClientHelloInner (easy), but contained in *some* ClientHelloOuter. What ClientHelloOuter does it construct? This gets especially thorny given HRR cookies, though note #333.\r\n* If the HRR was good for the outer but bad for the inner, the client I guess can stop offering ECH in the second CH, but that contradicts [this text](https://tlswg.org/draft-ietf-tls-esni/draft-ietf-tls-esni.html#section-7.1.1-2.1). Or the client can, as above, construct some dummy ClientHelloInner. (What does it construct?)\r\n\r\nOr the client can avoid all this disaster by matching the inner and outer preferences wherever it would affect HRR *acceptance*. Having an invisible complexity cliff in the spec is bad, so we should either:\r\n* Write down how to avoid this problem as a MUST and leave it at that -or-\r\n* Write down how to avoid this problem as a SHOULD and *also* write down what you do if you want to do the hard thing anyway.\r\n\r\n(We could partially simplify this by working an ECH acceptance signal into HRR somehow, but it wouldn't solve the dummy ClientHello problem, just the deferred error problem.)",

Remove the client-facing server's mandate to abort the connection if it receives the ECH extension but cannot negotiate 1.3 or higher. Presuming that a client MAY send a dummy (i.e., GREASEd) ECH extension without indicating support for 1.3, this mandate doesn't make much sense.\r\n1. Mandate that the client-facing server ignore the ECH extension if the SNI does not match the public name of any known ECH configuration. It is safe to presume GREASE in this case, since the client MUST set the outer SNI to the public name of its selected ECH config (see {{client-behavior}}).\r\n\r\nThis addresses https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/issues/295.\r\n",

Client sends GREASE ECH; want bypass (ignore the extension and continue as usual).\r\n2. Client sends real but stale ECH; want rejection.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell, there's currently no way for the server to disambiguate these, other than by using the public name. In particular, for (1.) it's true that SNI == public_name, and for (2.) it's true that SNI != public_name. I could be wrong about this, though :)\r\n\r\n> It doesn't cover if you're actually trying to visit the public name.\r\n\r\nIf you visit the public name with GREASE, then you'll get ECH rejection. If you want ECH to bypassed, then you MUST NOT send GREASE. For what it's worth, it's not clear to me why one would want to visit the client-facing server. It's sole purpose is to terminate the connection on the ECH rejection path.\r\n\r\n> And it closes off more specialized clients being more flexible in the public name in the future.\r\n\r\nThe spec is already inflexible about this. From 6.1, construction of CHOuter: 'The value of \"ECHConfig.public_name\" MUST be placed in the \"server_name\" extension.'

As is, it can only be known that ECH was rejected once the client sends the \"ech_required\" alert. I suppose this is doable, if a little annoying on the server side. In any case, the points you raise outweigh the benefits of this PR, so let's drop it.\r\n\r\nOne thing I would like to emphasizes is that we currently mandate that the client MUST set the outer SNI to the public_name when offering ECH. If we want to support future implementations that are flexible about the public name, then we'll need to relax this.\r\n",

I don't see much difference between a client implementation choosing to ignore the MUST in generating its ClientHelloInner supported_versions list, and a client implementation not supporting ECH at all. Plus, I could see future extensions or variants of ECH where we allow TLS 1.2 for the backend, and the server's handshake traffic is tunneled between the client and client-facing-server, and a check might make that difficult to do.

The only requirement on the public name is that it's some name which knows about and serves the client-facing server's config.

(If we're both happy with the text, but because we interpreted it differently, that's not very helpful!)\r\n\r\nI am saying it *is* important that ClientHelloInner to EncodedClientHelloInner is invertible. This is true in the status quo, and it remains true after #336. Handshake correctness requires that the server reconstruct the *exact* same value, byte-for-byte. Even though the extension order isn't very meaningful semantically, it changes what goes in the transcript and binders, so both sides need to agree. So if the client first assembles:\r\n\r\n`ClientHelloInner = (key_share, supported_versions, supported_groups, pre_shared_keys)`\r\n\r\nthen it compresses key_share + supported_groups as:\r\n\r\n`EncodedClientHelloInner = (outer_extensions(key_share, supported_groups), supported_versions, pre_shared_keys)`\r\n\r\nThe server will reconstruct:\r\n\r\n`ClientHelloInner' = (key_share, supported_groups, supported_versions, pre_shared_keys)`\r\n\r\nThese don't match, so the handshake will fail, both at the transcript and at checking the PSK binders. This isn't a security question because we haven't gotten there yet. It's a basic correctness question.\r\n\r\nNow, the thing that went wrong here is that the entire process of swapping extensions out for outer_extensions *only works if the removed extensions are consecutive*. Thus, this PR adds \"Removed extensions MUST be ordered consecutively in ClientHelloInner\" to EncodedClientHelloInner construction. For that precondition to hold, the client must have ordered the extensions it wanted to compress, thus we add a matching rule, this sentence, to ClientHelloInner construction. Now everything works out and the compression process is correct.",

What happens if the client and server use the trial decryption mode, where the config ID is empty and you only determine the config by using it? Perhaps this should be phrased in terms of the ECHConfig used. WDYT about:\r\n\r\n> If the client-facing server accepts ECH in response to CH1, it MUST check that the ClientECH.config_id parameter is the same between CH1 and CH2. If they differ, the server MUST abort the connection with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. It then MUST decrypt the extension using the previously-selected ECHConfig and, if decryption fails, abort the connection with a \"decrypt_error\" alert. Note that, if the connection used the trial decryption mode with an empty ClientECH.config_id value, the server does not continue to try other configurations on decryption error.\r\n\r\nThough this means, if the server believes in trial decryption, you need to remember *both* the ECHConfig *and* whether to expect an empty or matching config_id value.\r\n\r\n(As an aside, this admits another GREASE-distinguishing active attack, and one I don't see any way of avoiding.

In doing so, it flips the error handling from decrypt_error to fallback to be consistent. This, combined with the ClientHelloOuterAAD change, plugs an active sticking out attack for free. It also makes #342 easier because GREASE config_id collisions with real config_ids are now harmless.\r\n\r\nAlong the way, @chris-wood and @cjpatton observed that we're not authenticating the ECHConfig at all. (It used to be authenticated by way of the config_id, which was a digest.) Instead, just pass the ECHConfig into the info field of the HPKE context. They also noticed the server rule about PSKs on ClientHelloOuter didn't work with GREASE. Instead, we can simply remove it.",

If the extension value is empty, the server acts as a backend server and proceeds as described in {{backend-server}}.\r\n\r\nFrom there I think we can revert most of the changes at the start of {{client-facing-server}}, and just stick the adjective \"non-empty\" in the first sentence. {{backend-server}} probably wants to just use your second paragraph, and maybe clarify that the backend server just runs this logic unconditionally, so a potential client-facing server (the client may have just sent an empty ECH extension for no reason) and backend don't need to communicate much.",

Rather than running the server's CH1 algorithm with various modifications, we can just write a straightforward, simpler algorithm.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds some missing text for GREASE on HRR, which closes #356.

Because we don't expect servers to check consistency between CH1 and CH2, a client that goes out of their way to send something inconsistent may find that their (CH1, CH2) tuple is interpreted ambiguously. But the transcript reflects the whole tuple, so, as far as the handshake itself, the client is just causing its own preferences to be misrepresented here.\r\n\r\nIdeally ambiguous things would be unrepresentable and consistently treated as errors but HRR is what it is. :-/\r\n\r\n> (For example, I think an on-path attacker could modify the enc or config_id fields in CH2, without touching anything else.

Is that a way for an on-path attacker to quickly check if the connection is real or fake ECH?)\r\n\r\nI think real vs. fake ECH on HRR connections is entirely hopeless, short of completely redoing HRR. If CH1 uses ECH, we need to require CH2 also use ECH. That means ECH decryption failures in CH2 are fatal, and you can distinguish the two by simply replaying CH1 and perturbing the ciphertext in CH2. (That said, note that CHOuterAAD means whether a ClientHello triggers HRR is not under attacker control. So if a client/server pair doesn't trigger HRR, the attacker can't try to do this.)\r\n\r\nThat said, I think there's a variant of this on CH1 in the optional config_id mode. (See below.)\r\n\r\n> Chris asked if we should require servers to verify these match, and as you pointed out, that's a mess. (We also acknowledged that servers missing these checks is something we should expect to happen in the wild, which is somewhat why we are concerned about this re-binding attack in the first place.)\r\n\r\nYeah, this is the \"I think we got HRR wrong and have to live with it\" problem. :-)\r\n\r\n> I wonder if we can solve this in a different way: put these ECH extension fields in the AAD. That would prevent the modification above, I think, and shouldn't be too bad in terms of additional complexity.\r\n\r\nI don't think I believe this matters for HRR (only attack I can see is real vs fake ECH, which is hopeless with HRR anyway), but now that you mention it, I think there *is* a variant of this for the optional config_id mode in the non-HRR case.\r\n\r\nIn CH1, we don't bind config_id, enc, and cipher_suite to the encryption, so a priori an attacker might be able to perturb them without breaking the decryption. Perturbing enc and cipher_suite seems likely to break decryption anyway, but config_id is interesting. In the normal mode, it too will break decryption. In the optional config_id mode, config_id is just a placeholder. That means an attacker can distinguish optional config_id ECH from {GREASE or config_id ECH} by flipping the config_id, sending it to the server, and seeing if the client can decrypt the result.\r\n\r\n(Of course, all this is relative to an unclear and undefined \"don't stick out\" model.)\r\n\r\nComplexity-wise, I think it's fine, but note it changes the processing order somewhat interestingly, both for the spec and implementations. Right now the spec says:\r\n\r\n1. Make your CHInner. This should largely be running through your usual CH assembly logic.\r\n2. Encode it with the extensions you expect to compress.\r\n3. Make your CHOuter, minus the ECH extension. This should largely run through your existing CH assembly logic and computes CHOuterAAD.\r\n4. Take EncodedCHInner and CHOuterAAD and run through the Deserialize, SetupBaseS, context.Seal logic to assemble the final CHOuter.\r\n\r\nIn order to put these fields in AAD, we'd need to say:\r\n\r\n1. Make your CHInner. This should largely be running through your usual CH assembly logic.\r\n2. Encode it with the extensions you expect to compress.\r\n3. Make your CHOuter, minus the ECH extension.

So maybe we want to add more things to CHOuterAAD for that, though that is orthogonal to this PR, so I think we should deal with it separately.

The reason is, of the three stateless implementation options listed above, only the first one is robust. The second and third rely on the server performing a check that, if they forget, still interops. But if they forget the check, {{flow-hrr-hijack}} applies again. Given @cjpatton's question, I also suspect this mistake is reasonably likely.\r\n\r\nClearing `enc` forces servers to pick the first option, which is the more robust one. We're also guaranteed that a server, stateful or stateless, does not need `enc` (or `cipher_suite`) because you need to process ECH on CH1 regardless. Thus, I propose:\r\n\r\n* CH2's `enc` MUST be empty. Servers check this when parsing (now that it's empty rather than copied over, it's easy).\r\n* CH2's  `cipher_suite` MUST be {copied over, zero; not sure which}. Servers check this one too, just because it's really easy.\r\n\r\nEven more minimal would be if CH2's extension contained `payload` and nothing else, but we don't have any precedent for extension syntaxes varying between CH1 and CH2, so probably we shouldn't go down that route.\r\n\r\n@ekr, I'm curious what your thoughts on this are.",

The attack is as follows.\r\n\r\n```\r\nClient                       Attacker             Server\r\nCH\r\n +encrypted_client_hello\r\n +key_share (g^x)        --> CH -->               SH\r\n                                                   +key_share (g^y)\r\n                             SH'              <-- EE\r\n                              +key_share (g^a)\r\n                         <-- EE'\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. The attacker intercepts the client's first flow (`CH`) and forwards it to the\r\n   server.\r\n2. The attacker intercepts the server's first flow and transforms `SH` and `EE` into\r\n   `SH'` and `EE'` respectively, as follows. `SH'` is just like `SH` except that the\r\n   key share `g^y` is replaced with key share `g^a`, where `a` is known to the\r\n   attacker. `EE'` is a malformed handshake message encrypted using a key derived\r\n   from `g^xa`. Finally, it sends `SH'..EE'` to the client.\r\n3. If the client aborts with a \"bad_record_mac\" alert, then the attacker guesses\r\n   that real-ECH was used. Otherwise, it guesses that grease-ECH was used.",

For example, if ClientECH.cipher_suite isn't a valid cipher suite for the ECHConfig indicated by ClientECH.config_id, then the client-facing server skips this ECHConfig and moves on to the next.

In particular, we ought to ensure that, with high probability, configuration identifiers don't collide. A one-byte, randomly-generated identifier would make collisions inevitable, meaning that implementations will have to support trial decryption.\r\n\r\nI don't think one-byte necessary collides. First, note that the number of configs a server needs to have at a time is relatively small. Past the config's DNS TTL, you can retire it. That means you only need O(dns_ttl / time_between_rotation) configs at once. (From #177, I think the exact value is 1 + ceil(dns_ttl / time_between_rotation). Maybe add a little bit of leeway for people using stale DNS caches, though note we have a recovery flow so you only need to cover most, not all, of stale caches.) This means we don't need to worry about that many values.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, everything here is server-allocated. Whether you're worried about a birthday bound depends on how you allocate IDs. If it's random, you have a birthday bound, yes. If you cycle through a counter, you get the full range. (Compare how QUIC and DTLS 1.3 only send the low-order bits of the epoch.) If it's random, but you check for duplicates at key issuance, you also get the full range.\r\n\r\nThe counters or duplicate checks are trickier to issue, of course, though you can implement the trial decryption as a safety net. As of #344, the trial decryption and config_id modes are already unified. Specifically, decryption failure falls back to the outer ClientHello.",

As of #344, the trial decryption and config_id modes are already unified. Specifically, decryption failure falls back to the outer ClientHello.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be key. I agree that the fallback case is clear and well understood, though one consideration is the case wherein a client attempts GREASE to a server that actually supports ECH. The probability of collision in that scenario is high, and if that scenario happens often, then decryption failure and fallback to the outer CH happens quite regularly. Bumping the length back to eight bytes removes the collision probability for that scenario, I think. \r\n\r\nI'd like to propose we treat the two problems here separately. That is, let's first see if we can land the key ID change (from a client-computed hash to a server-selected ID). And then let's see if we can safely make that ID smaller in size. I don't think we need to address both here. Would that work?",

I agree with David, that your likely number of keys is ~2 (I might go as high as 4 if the server is in an extended period of offering two types of KEM).  With a one-byte identifier, that's only 1/64 greased sessions hitting the expensive decryption code.\r\n\r\nFlexibility here seems appealing, but I'm not sure that this is a place that needs it.  Operationally, this seems very much dependent on centralization, so I'm not buying any story based on loose coordination.  I also note that very small spaces reduce the options servers have for targeted tracking through the use of keys (though it is impossible to eliminate tracking, small spaces make the cost higher to operate tracking at any reasonable scale).\r\n\r\nThat is why I was motivated to go as low as 1 byte.  If you prefer a much lower probability of having to deal with failed decryption in response to greasing, then 2 bytes gets that down to lower than your likely failed connection rate at 1/16k.",

The spec mostly captures behavior of the overall client system, because that's all we can usefully talk about. (For example, ECH specifies a retry flow that involves making a new connection. At the level of many TLS libraries, including OpenSSL + derivatives, the caller makes connections. So instead the TLS library can expose APIs and document the caller's responsibilities as part of enabling ECH. Other interfaces may be create their own connections and handle this internally.) So whether it's the application or TLS, at the implementation level, isn't a hard deciding factor.\r\n\r\nSecond, with that said, yes, I expect that the majority of TLS <-> application interfaces will treat the ECHConfigList as an opaque blob. That is a good division of responsibilities because the TLS half already needs to process individual ECHConfigs in the ECHConfigList and select one based on its internal capabilities. Having to thread through application-specific DNS validation seems like it'd be complex. (But this is just my view as an implementor. The spec merely describes the overall behavior of the client system. How you choose to layer it is an implementation decision.)\r\n\r\nFinally, there's the question of whether TLS as a spec should have opinions here or if it should punt to some upper layer spec profile, as we did with 0-RTT. I don't think that's warranted here. RFC6066 already decided what can go in server_name, so TLS already is plenty opinionated on the shape of strings meant to be DNS names.\r\n\r\nThus, IMO, the simplest and most practical story is to have TLS handle this, rather than thread it up through all the layers.",

SNI or reference identity, we need to define what the type of the thing that goes in ECHConfig.public_name and what validation the client does. In particular, without validation, it gives the network more control over what goes into CHOuter.server_name than would otherwise be the case. Normally, in a typical HTTPS client, TLS can just assume the hostname has passed whatever checks earlier in the stack (URL parsing, DNS lookup, etc.) and so checks in TLS are not load-bearing. The public name breaks this because the TLS layer is fabricating a hostname on its own. So we should have TLS validate it before running too far with it.\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses (2).",

Do #426 and say public_name is exclusively DNS. If anyone adds IP in the future, the expectation will be a separate extension and thus not require any parsing to pick semantics.\r\n2. The exclusively-DNS public_name field is validated according to DNS rules and leave it at that. That at least avoids _completely_ unbounded DNS control on the ClientHello.\r\n3. Concede that we can't reliably exclude IPv4 literals at this layer. Call this out and say that clients MUST NOT validate the string as IP addresses. If your verifier has separate APIs for configuring DNS vs IP names for subjectAltName, feel free to pass the string as a DNS input and move on. If your verifier's API takes a more URL-like hostname, you should use whatever logic you used to distinguish DNS vs. IP and fail the verification if you think the string is an IP. (Effectively that verifier believes \"DNS:1.2.3.4\" is never valid because it has no way to spell it.)\r\n\r\nThis does mean the DNS can cause ClientHelloOuter to violate the RFC6066 prohibition on IPv4 literals, but since RFC6066 failed to specify what syntax it was prohibiting, the meaning of that rule is somewhat unclear.",

However, it doesn't seem to solve what I think of as our fundamental problem: any future extension to TLS 1.3 that is HRR-sensitive most not only consider how it changes the core protocol, but also how it interacts with ECH. Insofar as possible, we should design ECH in a way that mitigates friction when composing it with other protocol changes. Otherwise, I worry this could become the source of future bugs or vulnerabilities in TLS stacks.\r\n\r\nThat said, it may be the prevailing view that these sorts of composition issues are inherent to protocol design, and hence not worth spending too much time/energy trying to mitigate. I'd like to think these issues aren't inevitable. Admittedly, however, I lack the chops of others following this issue and may be incredibly naive :)",

ClientHello.cipher_suites cannot change in response to HelloRetryRequest, so it does not match the stated criteria. But in order for HRR to successfully apply to both, it must match. The PR also says 'which groups are\r\nincluded in the \"key_share\" extension', which is not supported by the proposed sentence. The proposed sentence would capture the entire key_share extension.\r\n\r\nFor me, I think the big question on matching vs. making a mismatch work (I now think we can do something much simpler than the HRRInner/HRROuter design, especially since we're discarding #333) is getting this criteria down. Whether we can write down clear and complete criteria that captures current and future[*] extensions and convince ourselves it'll work going forward.

We have the means to work out what the right answer is for any new extension.  And the default answer (it can't change) means that we won't often need to contend with that problem.  It's only when new key exchange methods arise that this becomes an issue.  Which is why RFC 8492 is potentially interesting, except that it really isn't[*].\r\n\r\n[*] RFC 8492 is badly specified; it doesn't say that ClientHello needs to include password_salt in [Section 4.5.2.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8492#section-4.5.2.2).  But it seems fairly clear in its intent.  The extension exists to communicate a salt, which leads to a revision to the value of the key_share value.  This doesn't really change the calculus, except that key_share handling gets more complicated.  None of that is visible at the level at which this text operates though.\r\n\r\nI think that I know where your objection comes from, but it's a fine point regarding wording rather than a point about its intent.

I think you and I are on the same page on the PR's intent (arrange for an identical set of acceptable HRRs between CHInner and CHOuter). But I think the text doesn't accomplish the intent. I'm using the complexity and accuracy of the text somewhat as a proxy for how future-proof it is, though there's also the more immediate concern that the paragraph is self-contradictory. :-)\r\n\r\nWhen you say figure out the right answer for any new extension, do you mean that each new extension where this matters should have some text relating to ECH? I think that's fine if we provide enough guidance (even if non-normative) that new extensions know what they need to do. (Do we need to update 8446 for this?) I don't think the general guidance in the PR works:\r\n\r\n> To ensure that a HelloRetryRequest is successful, clients needs to ensure that any values that might change in response to HelloRetryRequest are consistent in the two messages. \r\n\r\n> By consistent, this means that values in ClientHelloInner are identical to those in ClientHelloOuter, but with any values that only apply to TLS 1.2 or lower removed.\r\n\r\n>  Only extensions that change in response to HelloRetryRequest need to have any consideration for consistency between ClientHelloOuter and ClientHelloInner.\r\n\r\nThis general guidance isn't consistent with the goal of having an identical acceptable-HRR-set between the two. Suppose we added a parallel version of supported_groups + key_share tomorrow. By this guidance, supported_groups2 does not need to think about ECH, while key_share2 needs to be identical. But this is wrong on both counts. supported_groups2 *does* need to think about ECH, and only a subset of the information in key_share2 needs to match. (The latter isn't fatal. We could conservatively say key_share2 need to completely match, but I'll note that's not the strategy taken by this PR.)\r\n\r\nI believe the actual general rule is if the extension impacts what HRR messages are acceptable.",

You can only compress alpn and supported_groups. But those extensions are no longer contiguous, and a sufficiently strict reading of RFC8446 4.1.2 probably forbids reordering the extensions.\r\n\r\nSome ideas on ways out of this:\r\n\r\n* Don't compress the second ClientHelloInner at all. But this means wasting bytes because we're obligated to resend a bunch of stuff now known to be useless.\r\n* Allow the second ClientHelloOuter to arbitrarily change if the client feels like it. Then the client can arrange to compress the same way as it previously did (probably reusing the same code as above). But this means the rules on what the client does are weird and open-ended.\r\n* Don't compress the second ClientHelloInner at all *and* drop all extensions from the ClientHelloOuter because it's totally irrelevant at this point. This avoids wasting bytes and is well-defined, but it means yet another ad-hoc ClientHello serializer, albeit a pretty straightforward one.\r\n* Relax RFC8446 4.1.2 rules. You compress the ones that didn't change and reorder as needed. Wastes less bytes but still some bytes. Also it means the client's compression logic gets even more interesting cases.",

I've not stumbled\nover any detailed/strict DNS name syntax checks that I recall\ne.g. checking for <=63 octet label names or whatever else is\nneeded, though there may be such code already in order to\nsupport DANE. Would have to look and see TBH - but adding\nDNS name syntax checks that are only for ECH public_name\nwouldn't be so attractive if it didn't do the same as was\nalready done elsewhere in the library or by a bunch of\napplications using the library (that latter being v. hard to\nknow of course).\n\nCheers,\nS.\n\n\n> \n",

Though, in order to be useful for browsers, that syntax must be the messy WHATWG one or a superset.\r\n\r\nIt's a lot more complexity for ECH (lots of people now need to reimplement the WHATWG parser), but I agree it does avoid reasoning about `DNSName` -> `DNSOrIP` type transitions downstream... provided your `DNSOrIP` type is compatible with the WHATWG parser. `DNSOrIP<WHATWG>` and `DNSOrIP<RFC3986>` are fine. If your random protocol's `DNSOrIP<BrandNewVariant>` is even more permissive than WHATWG's IP parser, you're out of luck and need the SEP provisions.\r\n\r\nI don't think the SEP provisions are _quite_ that dire. Anyone transiting a `DNSOrIP` through their X.509 code has to be aware of the syntax *somewhere* because X.509 uses different name types for DNS vs. IP. Whatever you use to resolve that is the right parser to use when going from ECH's `DNSName` to your `DNSOrIP` type. And, hopefully, at that transition, the IP parser is readily available so we don't have duplicate code. Another thing to keep in mind is the public name doesn't need to interact with the *entire* system, just the TLS to certificate verification path. ClientHelloOuter handshakes are discarded.\r\n\r\nThat said, realistically, everyone just passes things around as strings, and you're right that this is something people need to remember to do.

That is, the `DNSOrIP` call is made for name resolution, TLS ECH, and certificate validation.  That's nasty duplication, so it's gross, but they could - at least in theory - share an implementation.  As you say, if one of those is more permissible than another in the wrong direction, we get bad outcomes.  To be clear, a lot else has to fail before this becomes a genuinely exploitable problem, but I don't want us to be making security holes.\r\n\r\nI put up a patch for NSS that does this validation in case anyone wants to cheat.

Certificate validation accepts underscores ('_') in names.  This includes the character at the start of the name, which is worrying enough for me to open a bug, but probably fine.  The question here is whether or not we need to include underscores also.\r\n\r\n2. The code detects the type of reference identity in a strict order: DNS, IPv6, IPv4.  That means that the DNS name recognition code is responsible for rejecting IPv4 addresses.  It does that by assuming that the input has been somehow normalized and rejecting any name for which the last label is only digits.  This means that it won't recognize `1.1.1.0x1` as invalid.  As we have normalization at other points in the system this is not exploitable, but I will be opening a bug on that.\r\n\r\n3. It also rejects `1.1.1.256` as a name.  As this is not a valid IP address according to the parser we are referencing, this PR would treat that as a domain name.  I think that is safe in the sense that @davidben notes.  If the certificate validation is more strict than the spec, the only risk is to interoperability.  (And in this case, ICANN would need to open up a `.256` gTLD, which is against their rules in addition to not working.)\r\n\r\n4. (Edited to add) It also allows a dot at the end of a name, but I think we're on firm footing here if we reject that (as the PR does).\r\n\r\n@chris-wood convinced me that we might not need to be perfect in all places `DNSOrIP` is implemented, as the certificate validation is the only security-critical one.  That's true when it comes to the main things we care about (server authentication).  It's also true provided that the secondary security properties (whether a name is exposed via SNI) are not interlinked.  I don't think we have any inter-dependency like that here.  @chris-wood did manage to identify a hypothetical scenario where disagreement does lead to failures, but it's not ECH-related.",

The fact is that most systems already have some sort of DNS and IP parser, some of which are probably not consistent with each other, and to now say \"you have to be consistent and here are the rules you must abide by\" just isn't realistic.\r\n\r\nWe had a case recently where Safari wasn't allowing SNIs with an underscore--because we were following the spec--but when someone complained (https://twitter.com/ifette/status/1375559666340618242?s=20), we discovered that Chrome and Firefox were allowing underscores and changed our policy to reflect this, even though it went against the spec. If we can't all follow the official DNS parsing rules now, without ECH, what makes you think we would all follow the official DNS and IP parsing rules later?\r\n\r\nIf we just say \"use the parsers you already have\" (and point to the WHATWG parser for those who don't already have one as @chris-wood suggested), at least we'll be gaining consistency within a system.",

We get either:\r\n\r\n* an ECH configuration is ignored because we falsely believe that it is an IP address\r\n* a bad ECH configuration with an IP address is used because we falsely believe that it is a DNS name\r\n\r\nFor the former, if this happens, then we might not use ECH when we could.  That's not great, but we might get bug reports and can fix the parser (or people can use better names).\r\n\r\nFor the latter, we will put an IP in SNI and maybe the IP will make it as far as certificate validation.  If the server has a valid IP certificate for that address, then maybe it just works.  Maybe the server chokes on the SNI.  Maybe the client code chokes on the bizarre IP address and fails (this is what moz::pkix would do, it is picky about the format of addresses as it assumes that the caller normalizes them).  If the server doesn't have a valid certificate, then the connection fails.\r\n\r\nIn this latter case, it seems like failure to validate the ECH config correctly more often leads to connection failures.  That suggests that the SHOULD is worthwhile, because we don't want some clients connecting and others failing to connect.\r\n\r\nCarrick is right to point to our collective differences, but I see that as unhealthy rather than inevitable.  We should fix the underscore thing by updating specifications to match reality (Anne van Kesteren is right about this...again), but I know the IETF well enough to be wary of proposing that, even if it would be the right thing to do.  I do think that the suggestion to reuse existing parsers is sensible.\r\n\r\nSo I'm down for making this change with a \"SHOULD\" in place of the \"MUST\".",

While https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/pull/436#discussion_r640744959 (i.e. no requirement or recommendation here at all) punts the problem to the application, it punts the problem consistently.

Especially since we seem to agree it won't cause security problems, it seems we should just stick with TLS not having an opinion, with non-normative text to point out this means DNS name.\r\n\r\nThe downside of libraries choosing to handle the SHOULD differently is that the ecosystem behaves differently. We'd have to consider both kinds of stacks when reasoning about the protocol. It's also less clear for any given implementor what the right behavior would be. We seem to essentially be saying \"you can reimplement the WHATWG protocol, which is just code, or you do less work and skip it, so do you want more code or less code?\".\r\n\r\n(I'll go put together some text for the \"consistently punt it\" option, so there's something concrete here.)",

DNS names have such-and-such syntax. Anything outside that syntax is invalid. (We could, optionally, exclude the tighter [RFC3986 definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.2), but see note below.)\r\n* When your application evaluates whether a certificate is valid for a public name, you must interpret the public name as a DNS name. That means, you should match it against DNS entries in the SAN list.\r\n* Note, however, that the syntax for IPv4 literals in URLs are also valid DNS names. (Non-normative, so we could even cite a living WHATWG standard without worry.) If your application would otherwise interpret the public name as an IP literal, you should make sure you don't go down the IP address matching logic.\r\n* At the TLS level, we consider the embedding of IPv4 literals in strings an application-specific thing and assume different applications may do this subtly differently.\r\n\r\nThe consequence of this is:\r\n\r\n* If your application's certificate logic already separates DNS strings and IP strings, you can just send the string down the DNS string path and don't worry too hard.\r\n* If your application's certificate logic takes a string and expects to parse out DNS vs IP address out of one string for web stuff, you should detect this (hopefully now your application's IP parser is available)\r\n* Servers that live in an ecosystem where \"127.0.0.1\" is not a valid DNS name should not use \"127.0.0.1\" as a public name because it won't work.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the web-specific `MakeOriginFromDNSName(\"https\", \"127.0.0.1\", 443)` function should fail because `https://127.0.0.1` gives back an origin that's interpreted as an IP literal, not a DNS name. It's not possible to express \"127.0.0.1\", the DNS name in the web.\r\n\r\nThis is slightly disappointing because, practically, that WHATWG-IP-literals are invalid DNS names is really a universal constraint. But we seem to have made enough of a mess here that I don't think we can guarantee the application won't think it is an IPv4 literal. (RFC3986 has [another definition](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#section-3.2.2) of IPv4 literal, but if we used it, we'd still allow a bunch of strings that, on the web, is interpreted as an IPv4 literal. So applications would need to account for this `MakeOriginFromDNSName` error case regardless.)",

The one that sadly allows IPv4 literals because IPv4 literals are ill-defined across all uses.\r\n\r\n> If the check is deferred to the application when validating the certificate, doesn't this run the risk of including an IP address in the outer SNI extension?\r\n\r\nIt does, but I think that's fine. I think the two risks here are that the DNS can induce the client to send some string in SNI to some server, and it technically violates RFC6066. The former doesn't haven't a clear threat model, more fuzzy \"well random private servers are often buggy\". I think it's reasonable to say we'll validate the DNS-level syntax and assume the server behaves equally well given \"a.b.c.d\" or \"0x1.0x2.0x3.0x4\". The latter is true, but RFC6066 doesn't actually define the syntax anyway. I'm not really sure how one is meant to interpret that prohibition apart beyond \"look deep into your heart and if this *feels* like an IP address, don't do it\". And under this interpretation, TLS truly,  deeply in its heart, wants a DNS name of \"0x1.0x2.0x3.0x4\". That the application will never accept any certificate for that *DNS* name is the application's problem. :-)\r\n\r\n(This is not a *great* interpretation. It's just barely self-consistent enough to say with a straight face, in hopes of getting out of this hole.)",

          "body": "So I think that this is - unfortunately - the only sensible answer here.\r\n\r\nThe original sin here was the overloading of names and IP addresses in every interface that has ever accepted input from humans.  That's convenient, but the fact that an IPv4 address and domain name have overlapping syntax is a real problem.  However bad that is, that's the situation we have to deal with.\r\n\r\n(For the record, 0x1.0x2.0x3.0x4 is a domain name always; the x makes it so.  IP addresses are always digits.  The real trick is in realizing that 127.1 and 2130706433 and 017700000001 are all localhost.)\r\n\r\nAs much as @davidben's idea here is appealing (i.e., the [SEP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somebody_else%27s_problem) cloaking field), that is a great way to get real security problems.  If you have an input that results in different parts of the system disagreeing about semantics, the time to next vulnerability (MTTV?) goes right down.  I know that we are in the business of expanding the attack surface, but that's a bit to easy.\r\n\r\nWe can't rely on \"usage\" context to protect us either.  Say protocol X says \"we don't accept IP addresses\" or protocol Y says \"we only accept strict decimal dotted quad\".  That doesn't work if someone forgets to validate inputs.  That a problem is someone else's fault doesn't absolve us.\r\n\r\nWe might be able to rely on ICANN.  Might.  They haven't enabled all-numeric TLDs.  Their current rules exclude the possibility.  If you trust in that, then looking for the last label being all digits might work, but I'm not going to advocate for trust like that.  I'll just write the code.\r\n\r\nI'll let you know how that goes.",

If we don't go with such a construction (which seems likely) and instead do #417 or #422, cookies will be in the clear. That means it is instead on the backend servers to construct cookie values without leaking information. This PR provides security considerations to that effect.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the requirements on backend servers within a Split Mode deployment are a bit onerous. I suspect, in practice, the answer is that Split Mode deployments cannot even use cookies on the backend server. Between HRRs being rare and stateless HRR being unnecessary over TCP or QUIC, that's hopefully fine. (Note this is different from #418, which was about the *client-facing* server being stateless. This applies if the *backend* server is stateless.)",

The server, in particular, needs to parse and then re-encode an arbitrary incoming ClientHelloOuter with transforms.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

As you say, less fuss, especially if you want to do whole-message rounding. I also prefer rounding to a multiple of 32 at the end. If we decrease the range of possible values, it's easier to GREASE.",

I feel it is better to definitively try to resolve the problem, or definitively punt it, rather than leave it ambiguous. That is:\r\n\r\n* Either, we decide that DNS's syntax rules are insufficient and we write down explicitly what we mean. Perhaps that's the WHATWG parser. That means we are deciding every TLS stack must have an implementation of that parser, that this implementation may well be redundant in many applications due to layering, and that we are okay with this.\r\n* Or, we decide that we don't want to deal with this at the TLS level. This means we prefer that there not be redundant parsers, that TLS implementations not parse this messy format, and that in exchange we are okay with punting this to application, with all the risks that entails of the application failing to handle this.\r\n\r\nI'm not opposed to either, but the more I think about it, the more unhappy I am with the SHOULD option. SHOULD seems to basically leave it to interpretation which side we're on.",

This does constrain the client behavior, though our draft implementation would not be affected by it. (We run through all the extensions in our usual order and compute the inner value + whether to compress it. If we intend to compress it, we write it to a separate buffer instead of the pending ClientHelloInner. Then we drop in all the buffered extensions, so they're contiguous and, in the EncodedClientHelloInner, write ech_outer_extensions instead of the buffer. This process keeps the relative order of compressed extensions, so we follow this rule anyway.)",

The name MUST be in the \"preferred\n    name syntax\", as specified by Section 3.5 of [RFC1034] and\n    as modified by Section 2.1 of [RFC1123].  Note that while\n    uppercase and lowercase letters are allowed in domain\n    names, no significance is attached to the case.  In\n    addition, while the string \" \" is a legal domain name,\n    subjectAltName extensions with a dNSName of \" \" MUST NOT\n    be used.\n\n(That text is near [1]).\n\nThat said, that \" \" is a legal domain name surprises me (and\nI'm a co-author of 5280!)\n\nBTW, I'm fine that that all gets fixed later if that's\nbetter.\n\nS.\n\n[1] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.6\n\n\n",

Just actually working it out was queued behind the various other issues to be solved.\r\n\r\nAs for something in ECH or more generic, it's true that padding may be relevant in other contexts, but the way the protocol works, we cannot introduce new mechanisms without some way to negotiate them. That would break compatibility. This can be smoothed over at some future TLS 1.4, where we can bake in the tweaks we want, but for now we need a way to signal it.\r\n\r\nWe can always choose to signal it with some completely separate code point later (`if ech || new_thing || tls14 { DoPaddingThing() }`). But while the use case is ECH, I think it is simplest to signal it based on ECH itself.

          "body": "A separate draft means that QUIC implementations of ECH need to handle cases where the client does and doesn't support this padding mechanism. That means a QUIC ECH deployment cannot rely on the preferred padding mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe record-level padding is more than just an API issue. QUIC's record layer is not a reliable transport. In order to properly hide lengths, you would need to handle retransmits as if the message were longer. That means padding needs to be integrated with retransmission logic, yet it is not sequenced like CRYPTO frames are. This gets extra fun if TLS believes it wants padding greater than a packet. (Consider, especially, whether an attacker can probe this length by manipulating which packets you see. The receiver doesn't know to block on an all-padding packet.) In contrast, something like this PR is embedded into the byte stream and we get the correct behavior for free.\r\n\r\nThe API issue has also only gotten worse over time, now that QUIC has been standardized and implementations treat their APIs as more and more stable. Indeed all this started because I went to get the needed support into QUIC APIs and implementation ahead of time. The overwhelming feedback I got from the QUIC side was that this was unreasonable, and the TLS WG agreed (https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/issues/264#issuecomment-686645194). As noted in #264, HTTP/3 does something similar, and introduces a [reliable padding scheme](https://quicwg.org/base-drafts/draft-ietf-quic-http.html#name-padding-and-traffic-analysi), separate from the transport's unreliable one.\r\n\r\n> I note that that would also match the layering of having the ClientHelloInner padding existing outside the handshake message.\r\n\r\nNot all places outside the handshake message are equal. The EncodedClientHelloInner padding doesn't have any of the above issues because its bytes are ordered. It also doesn't cross a protocol boundary. Indeed, this PR also meets this analogy by being outside the messages that we are trying to pad. That analogy mostly disqualifies sticking the padding into EncryptedExtensions, since that's deeply tied with the rest of message generation.\r\n\r\nIt *is* inside the transcript, but @martinthomson reported that'd be easier for NSS. An earlier incarnation of the Padding message idea was perhaps even closer to this analogy by mirroring ChangeCipherSpec: receiver ignores it and never passes it up to the handshake, but it's still sequenced with the other messages. (And, given how DTLS integrates retransmission and handshake state machine, integrating it into the handshake is probably indeed easier to reason about. Though I think sequence numbers are probably sufficient? DTLS, like QUIC, would need to integrate padding with retransmission.)\r\n\r\nIt also matches what we'd likely do in QUIC, had we decided earlier to outsource this kind of padding. To integrate it into the CRYPTO stream, we'd probably divide the CRYPTO stream into _ordered_ data and padding chunks. Well, the stream is already divided into chunks (messages), so the natural answer is to use that layer. That's a Padding message.",

That clears the compatibility bar for tweaking the handshake.\r\n* If the connection has the \"ECH confirmed\" bit, the client and server MUST send and consume _exactly_ one Padding message before each Finished message. Making the message required means the state machine always knows the next message to expect.\r\n* How many bytes go in the Padding message is up to the respective sender.

If the receiver does block the handshake on it, TCP concerns no longer apply but it's not \"after the handshake\" anymore.\r\n\r\nMoreover, making it post-handshake means it's after the key change, which gives a record boundary. Record boundaries are public, which means the padding becomes useless. It needs to be at handshake encryption level and buffered up and flushed to the record layer with the rest of the handshake flight. (But you may still have a padding-only record if you have more padding than your max record size. That's fine, the only requirement is that record boundaries are calculated independently of the padding/message boundary.)\r\n\r\nPost-Finished doesn't even keep it out of the transcript because the transcript is {..., ServerCertificate, ServerCertificateVerify, ServerFinished, ClientCertificate*, ClientCertificateVerify*, ClientFinished}. Any server message sent after ServerFinished but before reading ClientCertificate will naturally sandwich in there, unless we special case the message... at which point, why are we considering the transcript when positioning it?\r\n\r\nIf we want it to be post-Finished but pre-key-change and handshake-blocking, that's perfectly well-defined, I suppose, but having \"Finished\" not be the message which \"finishes\" the handshake seems weird. :-) We also need it after CertificateVerify due to variable-length ECDSA signatures. Put those together and we've uniquely identified the position: in between CertificateVerify and Finished.",

If that record can be reliably distinguished from the previous record (e.g. if an implementation always sends the padding and finished messages in the final handshake record from the server, and they are the only messages in that record), then the padding is no longer effective. \r\n\r\nI believe this scenario is addressed by the above warning about coalescing messages into a sequence of records, but I'm concerned it might be glossed over by implementors, especially if they send the messages one at a time without record-level padding assuming that the padding message is sufficient. Maybe instead it could be specified here that \"implementors MUST coalesce the handshake messages up through and including the padding message into a sequence of records so that the length of the records are identical, with the exception of the last record which can have a shorter length\"? While this is more restrictive, I think it may prevent some implementation errors down the road.",

I think syntax errors are already implicitly fatal and come with an alert (`decode_error`). Less special-case bits.\r\n\r\nLooking at RFC8446, we seem to have a couple styles here. Sometimes we just define separate types for each context and link them in prose: `KeyShareClientHello`, `KeyShareHelloRetryRequest`, `KeyShareServerHello`. Sometimes we define one structure with a select:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      struct {\r\n          select (Handshake.msg_type) {\r\n              case new_session_ticket:   uint32 max_early_data_size;\r\n              case client_hello:         Empty;\r\n              case encrypted_extensions: Empty;\r\n          };\r\n      } EarlyDataIndication;\r\n\r\n      struct {\r\n          select (Handshake.msg_type) {\r\n              case client_hello:\r\n                   ProtocolVersion versions<2..254>;\r\n\r\n              case server_hello: /* and HelloRetryRequest */\r\n                   ProtocolVersion selected_version;\r\n          };\r\n      } SupportedVersions;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess the latter is a little interesting because, for HelloRetryRequest, `Handshake.msg_type` is still `server_hello`. Maybe that's why we did key shares in prose...\r\n\r\n(Interestingly, our naming scheme for ECH is funny because it doesn't actually tell you the message, only who sends it. We say ServerECH rather than EncryptedExtensionsECH. And I guess KeyShare's naming convention is ECHEncryptedExtensions. Maybe time to rename since the server sends two of them now...)",

So I guess the single struct with `select` is the convention, but if you need to distinguish SH and HRR, as we do, do it in prose:\r\nhttps://github.com/tlswg/tls13-spec/commit/9a9c3295140bf4880ca031a6512e350da108713b",

This makes a few changes to the middlebox section:\r\n\r\nFirst, using \"MITM proxies\" when RFC8446 talks about terminating TLS was\r\nconfusing, so align with the RFC8446 terminology.\r\n\r\nNext, RFC8446 does not quite require dropping unknown extensions, only\r\ngenerating your own ClientHello. Dropping unknown extensions happens if\r\nthe proxy tries to intersect its true capabilities with that of the\r\nclient. I've also dropped the \"a more serious problem\" introduction\r\nsince the point of this section is that it's not a serious problem.\r\n\r\nFinally, I've dropped the \"non-conformant MITM proxy\" paragraph. It's\r\nslightly out of date now that we've unified everything around trial\r\ndecryption. I believe, depending on what the proxy does with the\r\nserver's EncryptedExtensions response, things will either break, work on\r\naccident, or retry loop and hit the limit. It doesn't seem worth\r\nexpending a whole lot of text on something that is the proxy's fault.\r\n\r\nThis does drop the \"Clients SHOULD NOT attempt to repair the connection\r\nin this case\" line, but the client couldn't really detect this case\r\nanyway. It looks like any old connection failure without a proxy, and\r\nthe usual considerations for changing your TLS config on connection\r\nfailure apply.",

Hopefully other folks agree. This still could use another\r\nediting pass (e.g. the first and second paragraphs both conclude\r\nwith the same thing), but I think it's an improvement.\r\n\r\nI've dropped the paragraph about about how the TLSWG has studied the\r\nproblem but had difficulties. That seemed more relevant when we were\r\ncomparing this approach against others.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraph then describes the setup (colocated servers) and\r\nwhat the extension achieves (stuff about anonymity sets). Thats\r\nredundant with the text above talking about how sometimes the server\r\nIP isn't identifying, and the text below talking about what the\r\nextension does. I've worked that text into those two paragraphs.\r\n\r\nI tweaked the bit about consistent TLS configuration, since it's not\r\nactually true: it's fine if the servers don't support the same ALPN\r\nprotocols. It's just a few externally-visible bits of TLS configuration.\r\nThat's probably worth defining more accurately, if we haven't already (I\r\nforget), but not in the introduction.\r\n\r\nI've also dropped the claim that we leak no more than the server IP. We\r\nhaven't addressed padding of application data, and cases where the\r\ncolocated servers have sufficiently different TLS configuration are out\r\nof scope.\r\n\r\nI tried to general tightened up language. For instance there was a paragraph\r\nthat says \"(assuming the server does not use domain-based virtual\r\nhosting)\" and then goes straight to talk about servers that *do* use\r\nvirtual hosting.",

Handling the Server Response is now Determining ECH Acceptance and\r\n   only discusses the initial accept/reject decision.\r\n\r\n2.

Determining ECH Acceptance is tidied up to discuss to what happens if\r\n   you see an older TLS version (it's a reject). In particular, in DTLS\r\n   1.2, the first server message might be HelloVerifyRequest and not\r\n   ServerHello or HelloRetryRequest.\r\n\r\n4. Accepted/Rejected ECH are now Handshaking with\r\n   ClientHelloInner/ClientHelloOuter to fit with the other section names\r\n   (lots of VERBing). They are unindented from (1) because that section\r\n   only talks about the accept/reject decision. This gives us a place to\r\n   discuss *all* changes to the handshake. We describe what it actually\r\n   means to handshake with ClientHelloInner, including implications to\r\n   the transcript. And...\r\n\r\n5. ...the portion of Handling HelloRetryRequest that discussed\r\n   constructing the second ClientHello never applied to the ECH Reject\r\n   case anyway, only ECH Accept. Move this to (4). Also expand on it so\r\n   it's a bit more clearly defined. I've also moved HPKE setup out of\r\n   Encrypting the ClientHello, as that's only relevant to one of the two\r\n   \"callers\" anyway. I'm not thrilled with this notion of \"partial\r\n   ClientHelloOuterAAD\", but the text used in Offering ECH and\r\n   Encrypting the ClientHello sections otherwise doesn't actually match.\r\n   Before this PR, both think they are responsible for constructing\r\n   ClientHelloOuter.\r\n\r\n6. With this and (1), Handling HelloRetryRequest is\r\n   now empty and removed.\r\n\r\n7. We forgot to write down the client half of\r\n   https://github.com/tlswg/draft-ietf-tls-esni/pull/461. There is now a\r\n   place for it in Handshaking with ClientHelloInner.\r\n\r\n8. We say that the ECH reject case ignores the HRR.ech extension, so ECH\r\n   GREASE says the same thing, to keep them aligned.\r\n\r\nThe Handshaking with ClientHelloOuter section could also do with an\r\neditorial pass, but I've omitted it from this PR because it was getting\r\na bit large as it is.",

Maybe we can handle that be deleting a few words. Suppose you are a server with zero ECHConfigs. The dispatch in {#server-behavior} still sends you to this section. The candidate ECHConfig values is then empty, so you'll hit this case. That means we actually should replace:\r\n\r\n> The server MUST include the \"encrypted_client_hello\" extension in its EncryptedExtensions message with [...]\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n> If the server is configured with any ECHConfigs, it MUST include the \"encrypted_client_hello\" extension in its EncryptedExtensions message with [...]",

If we want to allow >1 ECHConfigContents per ECHConfig then we should say that explicitly here and likely somewhere else too. \r\n\r\nI'd have to look again at the SVCB spec but I think this being redundant also means that a deployment needs to have >1 HTTPS/SVCB RR value to publish more than one key at a time.

It's about having multiple ECHConfigs in an ECHConfigList, and being able to skip over ECHConfigs from versions you don't understand. This property is a requirement for allowing us to experiment at all, without having to define a new SVCB/HTTPS key on every draft.\r\n\r\n(TLS structures are not automatically delimited by length prefixes. You need to know their definition in order to skip over them. That means we need a version-independent ECHConfig structure. The length prefix with opaque body gives that by hiding the version-dependent ECHConfigContents bit.)\r\n\r\n> a deployment needs to have >1 HTTPS/SVCB RR value to publish more than one key at a time.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what we want to avoid, and why we have the length prefix. Using separate HTTPS/SVCB RR values will result in either downgrade vulnerabilities on the client, or a lot of complexity. Keep in mind that DNS, connection setup, and TLS logic can come from different OS components or parts of the system. If we make the choice of HTTPS/SVCB RR depend on TLS capabilities, your DNS API needs to take in a description of your TLS stack's capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis would be excessive complexity in the way of deploying ECH, so we should keep the current, overall simpler design.",

I agree the current text is not right. However, this PR does not fix it. \"Any known ECHConfig\" is also weird after you've rotated 256 times.\r\n\r\nLet's take a step back here: we're encrypting a message for the client-facing server, which then dispatches to a backend server. An ECHConfig is a property of the client-facing server. It's the one generating the keys, etc. In fact, the backend server may not even have the key.\r\n\r\nIn the DNS, we *typically* only need one ECHConfig per route, because the client is ultimately going to just pick one. The multiplicity in the ECHConfigList is purely so a client-facing server can simultaneously support draft-13 and the final draft, or X25519 and fancy-future-post-quantum-KEM.\r\n\r\nHowever, we never design systems with unrotatable keys. That means, at some point, the client-facing server is going to generate a new a key and update DNS. DNS is cached, TTLs are lies, etc., so old DNS entries may still be used for a while after rotation.\r\n\r\nThat means the client-facing server needs to support a _window_ of ECHConfigs, perhaps the last week or so's worth, to avoid service interrupts. This window is *larger* than what's in DNS because, again, DNS only really needs the current ones.\r\n\r\nWhen the client-facing server gets a ClientHello, it needs to know which of those to use. It can either trial-decrypt, or it can filter on config_id. Trial decryption means, for every config you keep around, you have to do that many HPKE operations. That is poor performance and a DoS risk. Thus, we have a config_id, enough to disambiguate however many entries the client-facing server needs to keep alive. You *can* reuse config_ids, just, if you want to avoid trial decryption, you must have retired the old one first.\r\n\r\nThat means, when a client-facing server generates new keys, it should do so in a way that avoids collisions with any existing *active* ones. Rejection sampling is one strategy. Just incrementing and cycling IDs is another. (TBH, cycling seems simpler.)\r\n\r\nAll of this is relative to one client-facing server. If you use both CDN-A and CDN-B, A and B have separate sets of active keys and separate config ID spaces. There is no need for them to coordinate because we don't care about config_id collisions. CDN-A is never going to try one of CDN-B's keys.\r\n\r\nI'll take a stab at rewriting this.",

Ultimately, the ClientHelloOuter wrapper is entirely pointless here. Both sides know it will be ignored. Some clients will find it easiest to apply RFC8446 rules (reuse some code), while others cannot because whether HelloRetryRequest will consistently apply to both depends on complex rules we never managed to write down. (This was the crux of the HelloRetryRequest fuss.) Since we didn't want to define a whole new message without all the extra baggage, this section just says to do whatever.

My mileage is definitely still varying on the \"if the client retries\", as it's really outside of the context of 'this handshake', which is what that part is about.\r\n\r\nWould you say this would be equivalent?\r\n\r\n```suggestion\r\nsecurely disabled by the server, the client MUST NOT enable the False Start\r\noptimization {{RFC7918}} for this handshake (it may be enabled for the retry\r\nconnection), and the client MUST abort the connection with an \"ech_required\" alert.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm going to push a commit shortly that I think irons out the ordering issue you flagged.",

The requirement to validate the syntax of the encrypted_client_hello extension is co-located there under similar reasoning, which is that the syntax must be validated in order to proceed with the \"after the handshake\" processing that follows (although I think there is currently leeway there for an implementation to postpone the decode until after the handshake completes).",

Rejecting duplicates of extensions you know about is easy (it's a bitmask). Rejecting them of extensions you don't know about requires a sort, or building a hash table or so. We do this, but I've not seen any other implementation that does it.\r\n\r\n> I'd be fine with a change here, but let's make sure the algorithm in the appendix actually checks for duplicates.\r\n\r\nRight, that's the thing I am _not_ okay with. The algorithm in the appendix is duplicate-check-preserving, and it does no one any good to check for duplicates in the algorithm:\r\n\r\n* If you reject duplicates in your ClientHello parser, implement the appendix and it'll enforce there are no duplicates.\r\n* If you don't reject duplicates in your ClientHello parser, implement the appendix and you will avoid DoS but potentially have some duplicates. But apparently you were okay with that before ECH, so that's not really any worse.\r\n* If you don't reject duplicates in your ClientHello parser but _do_ separately reject them in your OuterExtensions decoder, you haven't done anything useful because OuterExtensions can still duplicate with an uncompressed extension.\r\n\r\nThis means the only useful place to apply this check is the ClientHello parser, RFC8446. But we haven't tried to get consensus on mandating ClientHello parsers check for ordered extensions. That would make a bunch of TLS implementations non-compliant. Thus I think the most pragmatic solution is to omit this requirement in ECH.",

For example, I would consider which cipher suites a server supports as part of a server's configuration. However, the order that extensions (e.g. key_share, pre_shared_key, supported_versions) appear in the plaintext ServerHello message is not typically a configuration value in the server but may be implementation dependent (since an extension order is not specified in neither the TLS 1.3 nor TLS ECH specs).\r\n\r\nOne could argue that these externally observable behaviors are part of the \"externally visible TLS configurations\", but I would argue that configurations should primarily refer to user-specifiable configurations to be consistent with the mental model I believe most server-providers would have upon reading the spec. I think it is therefore helpful to have additional text that points out that subtle implementation differences beyond user-provided configurations can result in servers being part of smaller anonymity sets than they may initially believe.\r\n\r\nA server's cipher suite preferences could be user-specified, but other implementations may opt for a single static preference which may be incompatible with another implementations preferences. Other distinguishable behavior that I believe is not user-configured but implementation-specific includes choosing to send EncryptedExtensions, CertificateRequest, Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished messages as separate records or pack them into a few records (which I believe is a subset of what David is referring to as division of data into record-layer boundaries).",

      "body": "DNS names and IPv4 literals are a bit of a mess. RFC 1738 said:\r\n\r\n> The rightmost domain label will never start with a digit, though,\r\n> which syntactically distinguishes all domain names from the IP\r\n> addresses.\r\n\r\nThis is sensible, but was replaced by RFC 3986 with a \"first-match-wins\" algorithm:\r\n\r\n> If host matches the rule for IPv4address, then it should be\r\n> considered an IPv4 address literal and not a reg-name.\r\n\r\nThe WHATWG URL spec originally mirrored this, but with a *much* more permissive IPv4 parser, to reflect reality. ECH originally cited this, to be sure we don't accidentally mix up IPv4 literals and DNS names.\r\n\r\nThe change in RFC 3986 was a mistake and introduced a security problem. The RFC 1738 formulation said a.1.2.3.4 was a syntax error, neither a DNS name nor IPv4 literal. The RFC 3986, along with the analog copied into WHATWG, says it's a DNS name because the IPv4 parser rejects it. But this means:\r\n\r\n- a.1.2.3.4 is a DNS name\r\n- 1.2.3.4 is an IPv4 literal\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/whatwg/url/issues/560\r\n\r\nThis means DNS names are no longer closed under suffixes! This causes problems for any systems (e.g. eTLD+1s) that need to suffix a DNS name. WHATWG since effectively reverted the RFC 3986 mistake. After https://github.com/whatwg/url/commit/ab0e820b0b559610b30c731b7f2c1a8094181680, the rule in WHATWG is: if it ends in a number (all digits, or 0x + all hex), parse as an IPv4 literal. Otherwise it's a DNS name.\r\n\r\nThis rule is finally simple enough that we can just lift it into ECH.\r\n\r\n(If we want, we can simplify this by just reverting to the RFC 1738 formulation, which should be safe in this context. It is a pity RFC 3986 made a mess here.)",

Why is ECH the right place for the TLS WG to take a position on this, even assuming we have consensus to do so?\r\n\r\n2. ISTM that the stronger rationale for this check is that (1) clients which don't out the correct value in ClientHelloOuter will not interoperate properly in case of the need for fallback (2) fallback will be uncommon and so this is unlikely to be detected in normal operation (3) the check ensures that clients do the right thing (this is the argument of RFC 9413). From this perspective, @sftcd's observation that nothing untoward has happened from existing server's failure to check doesn't tell us much, because it's in the nature of this kind of issue that nonconformance is mostly not a problem until it is, at which point it is hard to repair. \r\n\r\n3. I still don't think that the SHOULD/SHOULD combination works because, as noted before, RFC 2119 allows for implementations to violate SHOULDs and we don't really provide reasons why this might be OK in this case. I think the following combinations are reasonable (I.e., they provide interoperability by conformant implementations):\r\n\r\n* MUST send and any behavior by the server\r\n* MUST send unless you have some out of band reason to know that the server doesn't check and that it won't do fallback, combined with any behavior on the server.\r\n* Any behavior by the client combined with MUST ignore on the server\r\n\r\nWith that said, for the RFC 9413 reasons above, I believe we should require the client to send and encourage the server to check. I could be persuaded to have an exception for clients who have some out of band reason to believe that the server doesn't want it, as in my second option above.\r\n",

      "body": "This is a first attempt to propose some definitions. \r\n\r\nThere are indeed a number of problems in the document. \r\n\r\n- Some terms are inconsistently used, e.g. 'provider', 'ECH-service provider', 'client-facing' server. So I tried to fix that a little bit in the text. I think that the concept of 'provider' is actually good and is so indirectly understood, I wonder if there shouldn't be a bit more text to develop this good concept.\r\n- Some terms are abused e.g. 'public name' and 'public_name'. In addition on this one if you come the first time to this text, the immediate thinking is 'public name of what?'. So I understand why this term in the context of this text and understand it would be heavy to precise the 'public name of the origin server client-facing role' but still. Would be happy to discuss how we can make it a bit more explicit if at all possible.\r\n\r\nI am wondering if there are other terms that we should define too here but let's propose this first change.

In my mind, it is 'basic respect' to the reader to put the acronym in plain. \r\n\r\nOF COURSE I do understand that for developers these are completely obvious. I get that. But for Operational people or other persona, sorry, I am not coding TLS every day so I made a mistake to understand HRR or EE and for example AAD has two meanings ... which is calling why we might want to put more definitions (See my other PR on definitions).\r\n\r\nAnyway we can debate if X or Y or Z is well known or not but I think there are too many new things in this one and an Abbreviation section would help.\r\n\r\nAs said in IETF 118, ECH is complex, so am trying to help a little bit on that line, but if nobody happy with it, just reject it.\r\n",

I understand that the attacker can also improve its chances of not being detected, but it has to move up the [Pyramid of Pain](https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html) - just spoofing the SNI is an unreliable way to bypass advanced network security devices.",

How long is the window in which we won't have an open usable connection (with ECH or not) but we'd be willing to remember the past ECH failure/retry-config for? \r\n\r\nI'd also point out that we also can't assume that ECHConfigs always come from DNS for the purposes of working out an expiration time.

Adding in name checks a) complicates the validation process and b) prevents me from doing my new, totally awesome thing that might rely on invalid names.  Which I realize that I'm going to have to share now.  Here, it's incomplete, but it might at least make sense: https://github.com/martinthomson/ech-pnmasq",

A perfectly valid approach would include a completely valid configuration, aside from the mandatory extension that no one can support.  Then, if a connection attempt is made, the server can log everything, including the inner ClientHello.  I don't know what you /do/ with that information, but it's a trap for a very particular profile of stupid.\r\n\r\nYou can make the config more and more obviously silly, but who then are you planning to trap?

I have a proposal (unpublished) that points out that the public_name field can be any value as long as the client has a means of validating it.\r\n\r\nThat means that as long as the client needs to follow the validation rules in this document, then it will need to validate the public name on the basis of it being valid.  But that's just one way to perform that validation (and a particularly expensive one as it happens).  It is entirely possible to define other validation methods that do not require that the name be valid for DNS.\r\n\r\nIf I may, can I suggest instead that these requirements be moved to `{{auth-public-name}}` with a note there that says that clients MAY ignore ECH configs for which validation is obviously impossible.  Then you would list *there* things like the IP address matching and name construction as examples of things for which it is impossible to obtain a valid DNS-backed certificate.",

              "body": "This is a behavior change from what's currently in the draft.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of a mess. So, it used to be that WHATWG URLs followed this rule. But it leads to weird behaviors like:\r\n\r\n* `1.2` is an IP address\r\n* `a.1.2` is a DNS name\r\n* The eTLD+1 of `a.1.2` is `1.2`, which is not a DNS name\r\n\r\nTo avoid this chaos, the WHATWG rule changed to only key on the final component. If the final component is [numeric](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#ipv4-number-parser), it is an IP address (or an error). If the final component is non-numeric, it is a DNS name. This is a much better rule as it preserves the invariant that suffixes of DNS names are still DNS names, and avoids having to account for really weird things like...\r\n\r\n* `1.0xffffff` is an IP address (it's `1.255.255.255`)\r\n* `1.0xffffffff` is a DNS name (the last component is too big to stand in for the missing components)\r\n\r\nAlso this rule is still compatible with the IETF URL definition; the goal is to never produce a DNS name that someone else thinks is an IP address.\r\n\r\n(Why, oh why, did people make IP addresses and DNS names overlap? That was such a foolish decision! The original rule that LDH labels cannot begin with a digit was great.)\r\n\r\n**Alternative option**\r\n\r\nIf we want to avoid this mess, here's another option: don't do it at the ECHConfig rejection layer, and do it at public name verification. We say:\r\n\r\n* When you send the ClientHello, just put the `public_name` in there without thinking about it very much.\r\n* When you validate the certificate against the public name, you MUST treat it as a DNS name. If your verifier is unwilling to treat that input string as a DNS name (e.g. because it's URL-based and thinks that string is an IP address), you MUST fail verification\r\n\r\nThe downside here is that now an attacker can induce the client to put an arbitrary string into the `server_name` field, which the client would otherwise never be willing to send. If we *completely* do not validate the public name, this is a truly arbitrary string, which might be unwise. For example, if you put a NUL in the public name, you might upset some systems that assumed they could stick SNIs into NUL-terminated C strings.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the consequences of that are. I think we went with the validating option because there's no real reason to put in so garbage of a string in the public name, and it's tidier to just remove this possible mischief avenue.\r\n\r\nThe other downside is that publishing an ECHConfig with a garbled public name shoots yourself in the foot because the client will use the ECHConfig but refuse you the recovery flow. But so does publishing an ECHConfig with a syntactically valid public name that you don't control, so I'm not super concerned about this one.",

This seems like a mistake.\r\n\r\nWorse, if a future TLS 1.4 change the \"tls13\" prefix to \"tls14\", every extension will now become ambiguous! I've left that alone in this document, but we may need to contend with this later.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, we should have excluded the implicit \"tls13 \" prefix from the HKDF-Expand-Label function. Instead, the version-dependent labels could have been incorporated into individual labels as needed. (In particular, I don't think this label actually needed to be version-dependent.)\r\n\r\nInstead we seem to have implicitly decided that HKDF-Expand-Label is part of the \"interface\" that TLS exposes to its extensions, without remembering to say so clearly.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this PR does the minimal thing to paper over this mess.",

That's something we've more or less assumed about TLS in QUIC.  RFC 8446bis seems to be open still.  Is this feasibly something we could fix there?  (It's in AD evaluation, which is hardly so far gone as to make this sort of thing impossible.)",
